However, despite its significance, the present condition of Derawar Fort is deeply concerning. Many of its walls are crumbling, the bastions show signs of erosion, and the inner sections of the fort are in ruins due to neglect and lack of preservation.

Gulpur Mahuli waterfalls,"Gulpur Mahuli waterfalls Waterfall Gulpur Mahuli waterfall is a 110 km and a 3.5 hours drive from Islamabad. You can take two roads to get here; the first road to Gulpur Mahuli waterfall is from Islamabad  Kahuta Sehnsa Gulpur (Kotli Azad Kashmir); the second is through Rawat  Kallar Syedan  Dadyal  An Undiscovered Gem in Azad Kashmir  A Must Visit! I recently had the pleasure of visiting Mahuli Gulpur Waterfall, and it truly exceeded all expectations. Located near the scenic town of Gulpur in District Kotli, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, this waterfall is a perfect example of untouched natural beauty. The waterfall is surrounded by breathtaking green hills and steep rocky cliffs. The sound of water crashing down the rocks creates a calming atmosphere, making it an ideal place for relaxation and spiritual refreshment. Unlike commercial tourist spots, Mahuli Gulpur remains peaceful, clean, and free from crowdsespecially on weekdays. To reach the waterfall, you need to hike for about 1020 minutes from the main roadside or the nearest village. The path is relatively easy, although it becomes steep and rocky near the bottom, so good shoes are recommended. Great Spot for Picnics & Day Trips The flat rocks and shaded areas near the waterfall make it perfect for family picnics or day trips with friends. Many people bring snacks or even barbecue setups to enjoy a meal right beside the flowing water. Theres also a natural pool at the bottom where you can dip your feet or carefully bathe in the shallow parts (but always be cautious during high water flow). Photographers will love the views here! From morning sunlight over the hills to misty waterfall close-ups, every frame feels magical. It's also an ideal spot for nature lovers, vloggers, and solo travelers who want to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. The area is quite safe, with a nearby police checkpoint on the road and friendly local villagers offering guidance. Please respect the environment by not littering and keeping the place clean for others. I was happy to see minimal garbage and hope it stays that way. It's a scenic place on Kotli Mirpur Road. The waterfall is amazing actually there are three waterfalls. The place is calm, u enjoy being there. Try to go wearing some athletic shoes as place is slippery and it is at some distance from main road. There is no shop nearby so bring eating stuff with urself to enjoy in a wholesome way.

Not far from there, I also explored the stunning Princess of Hope, a naturally shaped rock formation that looks like a standing woman. It's truly a wonder of nature and a must-see if youre in the area. The view from there is breathtaking, especially during sunset.

Jahaz Banda Kumrat Valley,"Jahaz Banda Kumrat Valley Waterfall Jahaz Banda Waterfall is the mightiest of the several waterfalls in Kumrat Valley in Sherigan, near Dir. Jahaz Banda waterfall is 380 Kms and 10 hours drive from Islamabad, so leave early. A great destination for nature lovers. Youll need to take a two-hour jeep ride followed by a 2.5 to 3-hour hike to reach it. The trail offers beautiful scenery and moderate slopesnothing too difficult.

Khewra Salt Mine,"Khewra Salt Mine Mine The Khewra Salt Mine is located in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest and oldest salt mine and the world's second largest source of salt. It is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 B.Th. main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. It is quite a unique natural phenoma thankfully well maintained by the authorities. It is the second largest pink salt reserve in the whole world. The salt emanates light in different shades of pink and orange giving a mysterious effect quite pleasant to the eyes. The salt is natural healer in many ways especially to asthmatic patients.

It's an impressive sitefascinating both in terms of natural beauty and historical value. The moment you enter, you can feel the uniqueness of the place, with tunnels carved out of pink Himalayan salt and beautiful salt formations illuminated with colorful lights. One thing to note: there was a bit of a wait for the train that takes you into the mine. It's a small electric train that only carries a limited number of people at a time, so depending on the crowd, you might have to be patient. But once on board, its a short and enjoyable ride through the salt tunnel. The entire tour lasts around an hour, which is just enough time to explore the main highlights, including salt sculptures, the underground mosque, the mini salt bridge, and a small brine pool. The guide was knowledgeable and shared some interesting facts about the history and working of the mine. Overall, its a worthwhile stop if youre in the area.

Kiwai Kaghan,"Kiwai Kaghan Waterfall Kiwai is a small waterfall and picnic spot on the way to Naran. It is so popular in traveling families; therefore I have included it in my list. Kiwai waterfall and picnic spot is 190 km and 5.5 hours from Islamabad. The place is really nice as so many restaurants offer seating over the water fall. But its certainly crowded and one can only enjoy the waterfall from a higher level rather than sitting in a crowded place. Its important to offer higher end services with some focus on ambience which the locals lack to understand. Kiwai waterfall is a lovely tourist attraction, not just a waterfall for show, you can dine and eat delicious trout fish, chicken karahi and daal maash. Everything taste exceptional. More than that, you can climb up to go to the top of waterfall and have a great photo session. If you are visiting naran, balakot, kaghan or shogran you must visit kiwai waterfall. Great place Kewai Waterfall is one of the most refreshing and scenic stops on the way to Naran, located a short drive from the town of Balakot in the Kaghan Valley, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Its a natural gem where cascading water flows down the mountainside, creating a cool and lively atmosphere that attracts thousands of tourists heading toward Naran and beyond. Natural Beauty and Atmosphere The waterfall is surrounded by lush green hills, tall pine trees, and vibrant plant life. The sound of water hitting the rocks creates a soothing, natural rhythm that blends beautifully with the mountain air. The area is rich in greenery, offering a perfect backdrop for photos and moments of relaxation. Cool winds blow through the valley, and many visitors stop here to dip their feet in the refreshing water or simply relax near the streams. Its an ideal place for a quick break, especially on hot summer days when the water feels ice-cold and invigorating. Popular Stop for Tourists Kewai Waterfall is a favorite resting point for tourists traveling to Naran, Saif-ul-Malook, and Babusar Top. Its easy to access by car, and roadside parking is available. Many families, bikers, and tour groups pause here to freshen up, take pictures, or enjoy a snack beside the flowing water. Food and Local Shops  Important Note There are several tea stalls, small dhabas, and roadside vendors selling snacks, fries, pakoras, and beverages. However, be extremely cautious when buying food or drinks here, as the rates of eatables are shockingly highup to 200 times more than normal prices in Naran or other cities. A simple cup of tea or a small plate of fries can cost far more than expected. It is highly recommended to: Bring your own snacks and drinks. Confirm prices before ordering anything. Avoid overspending at these roadside stalls. Things to Do Photography: The waterfall and surrounding greenery are great for nature photography. Foot Dipping: Enjoy the icy water by dipping your feet for a quick refresh. Short Stay: It's an ideal stopover, not a place for extended stays or camping. Safety and Cleanliness The rocks near the waterfall can be slipperywalk with caution. Do not climb near or under the waterfall; accidents can happen due to slippery paths. Unfortunately, some visitors throw trash in the water or leave wrappers and bottles behind. Please help keep the area clean by using dustbins or carrying your garbage back with you. Conclusion Kewai Waterfall is a peaceful and refreshing spot that adds beauty and joy to your journey through the Kaghan Valley. Its a perfect place to pause, refresh, and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. However, be cautious about overpaying for food and help protect this natural attraction by keeping it clean.

Lahore Fort,"Lahore Fort Fort The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. A timeless masterpiece of Mughal architecture  a must-visit for anyone who truly wants to experience the heart of Lahores history and culture. The Lahore Fort, locally known as Shahi Qila, is one of those rare places where you can genuinely feel the layers of history come alive around you. Located at the northern end of Lahores old walled city, right beside the majestic Badshahi Mosque, this fort is not just a tourist attraction  its a journey through centuries of art, power, and empire. I visited the fort on a calm afternoon, and it turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences Ive had in Lahore. The entrance through the Alamgiri Gate immediately sets the tone  grand, imposing, and filled with Mughal charm. As you walk in, you cant help but imagine how emperors like Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan once walked these same pathways. Every corner tells a story. The fort isnt a single building but a whole complex  with palaces, courtyards, gardens, and beautifully decorated halls that reflect different eras of Mughal and later Sikh influences. The Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors) is without doubt the highlight. The mirror work inside is breathtaking  thousands of tiny glass pieces reflect light in such a mesmerizing way that it feels almost magical. Even after centuries, the craftsmanship remains stunning. The Naulakha Pavilion is another gem  elegant white marble, intricate floral carvings, and a peaceful balcony view overlooking the city. You can easily spend hours admiring the details and still find something new every time you look closer. What I really appreciated was the forts restoration and preservation efforts by the authorities and UNESCO. Although some parts are still under maintenance, its heartening to see that the forts glory is being carefully revived rather than modernized. Information boards around the complex provide historical context, which makes the visit educational as well as visually fascinating. The museum section inside is worth a visit too. It houses ancient coins, Mughal armory, paintings, manuscripts, and artifacts that give you an even deeper insight into how life must have been during the Mughal era. The staff were polite and helpful, and the ticketing process was smooth. If youre planning to visit, Id recommend coming in the late afternoon when the light softens  its the perfect time for photography, especially when the sun hits the marble and red sandstone walls. The fort is right next to the Badshahi Mosque, Hazuri Bagh, and Minar-e-Pakistan, so you can make it part of a full-day heritage tour. In short, Lahore Fort isnt just a monument  its a living story of art, culture, and resilience. Whether youre a history lover, a photographer, or simply someone seeking inspiration, this place will leave you speechless. A must-see landmark that captures the true soul of Lahore and the golden age of the Mughal Empire. Its boring, we were done after getting some pictures. The government should work hard to preserve the originality of fort, as I saw most people ruining walls. Plus there is nothing other than the walls to see. There should be libraries, monuments. Some kind of of theme, to build public interest. Lahore Fort, also called Shahi Qila, is a magnificent Mughal monument built mainly by Emperor Akbar in 1566 and later expanded by Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb.

Lake Saif-ul-Malook,"Lake Saif-ul-Malook Lake This beauty is located at the northern end of Kaghan Valley. It is in the north-east of Mansehra Division of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Not only the mountains surrounding it make the place beautiful, but its reflection in the lake is definitely breathtaking. There is no peace and no cleanliness at Saif ul Maluk Lake. Many shops are set up in front of the lake, which badly affect its view. It could be much better if these issues were addressed. Not recommended! This place is magical and offers stunning views. We visited at the end of May 2025. It was quite crowded, and the roads were a bit rough. The only way to reach this destination is by traveling in a 4x4 jeep. A Magical October Visit to Lake Saiful Malook Visiting Saiful Malook in October was nothing short of a dream. Nestled in the majestic Kaghan Valley near Naran, this lake has a charm that words can barely capture. By the time I reached the top, the crisp mountain air, the stillness of the surroundings, and the sight of the lake surrounded by snow-capped peaks created a scene straight out of a fairytale. October, I found, is a perfect time to visit  the summer crowds have faded, the roads are still accessible, and the early winter snow has started to blanket the mountains in pure white. The journey itself was an adventure. The road from Naran to the lake winds through rugged terrain, and while its only about 9 kilometres, the steep ascent and rocky path make it feel longer. Many tourists choose to take jeeps driven by locals who navigate the track expertly, adding a sense of thrill to the trip. Along the way, pine trees thin out and the landscape opens into a wide basin surrounded by towering peaks, with Malika Parbat standing proudly as the highest of them all. When I arrived, the view simply took my breath away. The lakes water was crystal clear, reflecting the snowy mountains like a mirror. The thin layer of snow covering the surrounding hills gave the whole area a serene and magical glow. The temperature was cold but refreshing, and the silence was broken only by the sound of wind brushing through the peaks. Standing there, it felt like time had stopped  as if nature wanted to remind me of its untouched beauty and peace. The local people near the lake were warm and welcoming, offering hot tea and simple snacks. I sat by a small tea stall overlooking the lake, sipping chai while watching the sunlight dance on the water. Its amazing how something so simple can feel so grand when youre surrounded by such breathtaking scenery. I also learned that locals tell a romantic legend about the prince Saiful Malook and fairy princess Badi-ul-Jamal, which adds a mystical element to the experience. October gave me the best of both worlds  clear weather with a touch of early winter magic. The slight chill in the air, the snow on the mountains, and the golden sunlight made it a photographers paradise. For those who love nature, peace, and a bit of adventure, Saiful Malook in October is absolutely a must-visit destination. As I left, I felt grateful for witnessing one of Pakistans most beautiful natural wonders. Saiful Malook is not just a lake; its an emotion  a place where mountains meet the sky, legends come alive, and every breath feels like a prayer of gratitude. I will surely return, but the memory of that October snow and the silence of the lake will stay with me forever.",lake saif ul malook lake beauty locate northern end kaghan valley north east mansehra division khyber pakhtunkhwa province mountain surround place beautiful reflection lake definitely breathtake peace cleanliness saif ul maluk lake shop set lake badly affect view well issue address recommend place magical offer stunning view visit end crowded road bit rough way reach destination travel jeep magical october visit lake saiful malook visit saiful malook october short dream nestle majestic kaghan valley near naran lake charm word barely capture time reach crisp mountain air stillness surrounding sight lake surround snow cap peak create scene straight fairytale october find perfect time visit summer crowd fade road accessible early winter snow start blanket mountain pure white journey adventure road naran lake wind rugged terrain kilometre steep ascent rocky path feel long tourist choose jeep drive local navigate track expertly add sense thrill trip way pine tree thin landscape open wide basin surround tower peak malika parbat stand proudly high arrive view simply take breath away lake water crystal clear reflect snowy mountain like mirror thin layer snow cover surround hill give area serene magical glow temperature cold refreshing silence break sound wind brush peak stand feel like time stop nature want remind untouched beauty peace local people near lake warm welcoming offer hot tea simple snack sit small tea stall overlook lake sip chai watch sunlight dance water amazing simple feel grand surround breathtaking scenery learn local tell romantic legend prince saiful malook fairy princess badi ul jamal add mystical element experience october give good world clear weather touch early winter magic slight chill air snow mountain golden sunlight photographer paradise love nature peace bit adventure saiful malook october absolutely visit destination leave feel grateful witness pakistans beautiful natural wonder saiful malook lake emotion place mountain meet sky legend come alive breath feel like prayer gratitude surely return memory october snow silence lake stay forever

The mosque was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a part of an ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam baths I entered Old Lahore through the historic Delhi Gate, and after a 5-minute walk through the lively and narrow streets, I reached Masjid Wazir Khan. The journey itself felt like stepping back in time surrounded by centuries old buildings, street vendors, and the energy of Lahore. The mosque is truly a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. Its vibrant tilework (kashi kari) and intricate frescoes are breathtaking up close. Unlike larger Mughal monuments, Wazir Khan Mosque feels intimate, detailed, and rich with atmosphere. The courtyard is peaceful despite the bustling city just outside. Masjid Wazir Khan, located inside Delhi Gate, is truly one of the most beautiful examples of Mughal architecture in Lahore. Built in the 17th century, the mosque is famous for its intricate fresco paintings, tile work, and calligraphy that cover almost every wall and arch. The level of detail in the artwork is breathtaking and feels like stepping into a living museum of Islamic art. The courtyard is spacious and peaceful, offering a sense of calm despite being in the heart of the bustling Walled City. The mosque is well-preserved, and restoration efforts over the years have helped maintain its charm, though more care could still be taken in some areas.

Its not just a place of worship, but also a cultural treasure that showcases the beauty and artistry of Mughal-era Lahore.

Evening is the most popular time for visitors, when the tower is lit up and the weather is coole Be prepared for potential issues with maintenance and closed access to some areas. Some reviewers suggest appreciating the monument from a distance rather than expecting a pristine tourist experience up close. Minar-e-Pakistan is a breathtaking monument that embodies the country's rich history and cultural heritage. Located in Lahore's Iqbal Park, this iconic structure stands tall as a symbol of Pakistan's independence and unity. Its unique blend of Mughal, Islamic, and modern architectural styles makes it a stunning sight to behold.

Mohatta Palace,"Mohatta Palace Museum The Mohatta Palace is a museum located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. Designed by Agha Ahmed Hussain, the palace was built in 1927 in the posh seaside locale of Clifton as the summer home of Shivratan Mohatta, a Hindu Marwari businessman from what is now the modern-day Indian state of Rajasthan. Mohatta Palace is one of Karachis most stunning and well-preserved historical landmarks. Built in 1927 by Rai Bahadur Seth Shivratan Mohatta, a wealthy Marwari businessman, this magnificent structure was originally designed as his seaside residence. The palace is constructed using beautiful pink Jodhpur (Jaipur) stone combined with local yellow stone, giving it a unique and majestic appearance. Architecturally, the palace is a masterpiece. It features a blend of Mughal and Rajasthani styles, with elegant domes, intricately carved arches, winding staircases, charming balconies, and serene courtyards. The interior and exterior of the building are equally captivating, and the surrounding gardens add to its peaceful ambiance. Today, Mohatta Palace serves as a museum and cultural center, hosting various exhibitions, art displays, and heritage events. It offers visitors a chance to explore Karachis rich history and appreciate the artistic and architectural brilliance of the past. Whether youre a history lover, a tourist, or a local exploring your citys roots, Mohatta Palace is a must-visit destination. Its more than just a building  its a journey into the elegance and grandeur of colonial-era Karachi. Highly recommended for families, students, and culture seekers! Its a nice building to go by for a quick stop. Especially good place for people interested in local textiles. Quaid's gallery was not quite impressive. Mobile phones/cameras are not allowed inside, which seems like overdoing security because even museums with quite old artefacts do not bare carrying them. Overall, a good one hour stay is fine. But not worth going out for out of the way. One thing that was disappointing to me was the museum staff downplaying the building's association with the princely family of Bhopal. I asked the lady at reception whether there is anything related to the princely state or the family to which it belonged, and she straight up said it was an evacuee property left by the Hindu seth Mohatta. Ardeshir Cowasjee wrote a very informative piece on the history of both Mohatta Palace and the nearby Bhopal House with the family of Abida Sultaan, daughter of Bhopal's nawab and mother of Sheharyar Khan  the former Foreign Secretary. Willingly ignoring history is not cool. Mohatta Palace is a beautiful historic palace located in the heart of Clifton, Karachi. Built in 1927, it is one of the city's most charming and well-preserved landmarks. With its stunning architecture and rich cultural exhibitions, its considered one of the best places to visit in Karachi for history lovers, tourists, and art enthusiasts.

The waterfall itself is stunning, surrounded by lush greenery and set in a quiet valley, but do note that the small bridge leading to it is currently broken so you'll need to wade through shallow water to reach the base, which adds a bit of fun adventure to the experience. The roads from Islamabad are newly paved and in excellent condition, making the drive smooth and enjoyable; however, avoid following Google Maps through Kahuta, as it takes you on narrow, risky roads and instead you should stick to the main highway route for a safer and faster journey.

The water is really refreshing, but the edges get deeper fast, so if you cant swim or have children with you, stay towards the center where its more shallow. There arent many facilities, so bring water, snacks, and any essentials you might need for your trip. Noori Waterfall is also a fantastic spot for a picnic or just chilling and taking in the calm vibe. Whether you love exploring new places or just want to enjoy some beautiful scenery, youll have a memorable time here. Highly recommended! Had a great time at Noori Waterfall. From Islamabad (F-6) it took about 2 hours to reach Jabbri Bazaar. The road is carpeted till here, then cement with a small off-road patch. We went in a Daihatsu Mira and had no issues. Another 30 minutes to the parking with no entry fee. Life jackets cost Rs. 100 and its a 15-minute walk to the waterfall. Reached at 11 AM and had the place all to ourselves. No shops around, so bring your own food and water. Signals are weak here, but the beauty makes up for it.

Pakistan Monument,"Pakistan Monument Monument The Pakistan Monument was inaugurated in Islamabad on 23 March 2007 as a national monument embodying the country's history, and is in effect rich with significant cultural references. For its design, architect Arif Masood drew inspiration from the figure of a blossoming flower to represent the four provinces and three territories into which Pakistan is subdivided. Last month, I had the opportunity to visit the Pakistan Monument with my friends, and it was truly a memorable experience! This architectural masterpiece beautifully represents the unity and diversity of Pakistan. The massive petals with intricate carvings tell the story of our nations history, making it a place of pride and reflection. The view from the monument is simply breathtaking, especially at sunset, when the city lights start twinkling in the distance. The Pakistan Monument Museum was another highlight of our visit, offering a deep dive into the countrys rich history through well-maintained exhibits and interactive displays. The place is clean, well-maintained, and has a peaceful ambiance, making it perfect for both tourists and locals.

Panjpeer Rocks,"Panjpeer Rocks Mountainous Panjpeer is the highest point of the Danoi Ridge in Kotli Sattian/Kahuta. It is called Panjpeer because of a shrine it has at the top.

The area is occupied with mountains, rocks, trees, valleys and fountains making it a perfect tourist spot. This serenity and scenic landscape of this place can't be described through these pictures. A two hours bike ride takes you here from twin cities. The road is perfect (except for some very last 50m) and I'd recommend going there via bike for a wholesome experience of the route. Go there for a sunrise or sunset view. Nvm there is plenty of tree shade too. Very peaceful and picturesque ambience. I'd like to try camping here next time (hope so there is a clean night sky). Ps: It was so sad seeing plastic bottles, snacks wrappers etc lying there. Please refrain from leaving your travel waste there in open. Try to collect it in plastic bag to dispose of properly. The city is just half an hour from there. Let this beautiful place be in its own shape. Nice place to visit with family. 2 hrs drive from zero point Islamabad. Weather at noon and afternoon is cold.

Rohtas Fort,"Rohtas Fort Fort Rohtas Fort is a 16th-century fortress located near the city of Jhelum in the Pakistani province of Punjab. The fort is one of the largest and most formidable in the subcontinent. Rohtas Fort was never stormed by force, and has survived remarkably intact. A Majestic Fort with a Strong Summer Warning Rohtas Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site near Jhelum, is a monumental testament to 16th-century Muslim military architecture. Commissioned by the formidable Pashtun ruler Sher Shah Suri, its massive walls and strategic location make it an essential destination for history and architecture enthusiasts. However, visitors should heed a crucial piece of advice: exploring the grandeur of Rohtas Fort is an experience best saved for the cooler months, as the intense summer heat can make a visit extremely challenging. A Glimpse into a Storied Past Built between 1541 and 1548, the fort was a masterpiece of strategic design, intended to suppress local tribes and defend against the return of the exiled Mughal emperor, Humayun. The architecture is a fascinating blend of Afghan, Persian, and local traditions, creating a unique style that later influenced Mughal forts. The sheer scale is breathtaking, with fortified sandstone walls stretching over four kilometers, punctuated by 68 bastions and 12 monumental gates. Key structures like the Haveli Man Singh, the Rani Mahal, and the impressive Shahi Mosque offer a glimpse into the life and culture of the era. Why Summer Visits are Not Recommended The summer in Punjab brings extreme heat, and the fort's exposed, rugged terrain offers little respite. Exploring the vast 70-hectare expanse requires extensive walking on uneven ground, which becomes a strenuous and uncomfortable task under the scorching sun. For a pleasant and truly immersive experience, planning your visit during the cooler, more forgiving months from October to March is highly recommended. Planning Your Visit Rohtas Fort is open daily from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Entry tickets are priced at PKR 500 for foreign tourists and PKR 50 for local visitors. Given the fort's vastness, consider hiring a local guide. It is essential to wear comfortable walking shoes and to bring an ample supply of water and snacks, as facilities within the fort are limited. A Must-See, but in the Right Season Rohtas Fort is a magnificent historical site that offers a captivating journey into the past. Its grandeur and architectural brilliance are undeniable. However, to fully appreciate its splendor, it is essential to visit during the right season to ensure a comfortable and memorable experience. Its a nice beautiful ruins of an old fort. The tour guide seemed knowledgeable and kept us entertained with facts about the place. There is a lot of walking and climbing stairs involved so be careful. There is a golf cart bus service available too but its limited. Make sure to take water with you. Wear clothes that will go straight to the washer later. Rohtas Fort is located on the outskirts of Dina city, about a 30-minute drive from the city center. As someone who has visited many forts due to my interest in history, I can confidently say this is the largest and most impressive fort I have seen. Its massive, very well-preserved, and heavily fortified. We had an elderly guide who gave us an excellent tour, explaining the history behind every part of the fort  why it was built, how it was built, and who built it. The fort was constructed by Sher Shah Suri as a defense against Mughal invasions. Architecturally, its designed to function as a fortified city, and its structure shows how advanced and secure it was in the 16th century. The fort is not just historically rich but also a peaceful place ideal for contemplation and relaxation. It has multiple gates, each historically linked to different cities. For anyone interested in history, this site is highly recommended. However, a few things to keep in mind  if you're visiting with young children, be very careful. Many areas on top of the fort lack protective barriers or walls, making it risky for small kids. There is a canteen, but the prices are very high. I suggest bringing your own food and especially water. I visited in January, during winter, and even then, walking around the fort was exhausting. Water is a must. There is also a museum inside the fort, which is free to enter. However, photography is not allowed inside the museum. Despite these minor issues, Rohtas Fort is a fantastic place to visit for anyone who appreciates history and heritage.",rohtas fort fort rohta fort century fortress locate near city jhelum pakistani province punjab fort large formidable subcontinent rohta fort storm force survive remarkably intact majestic fort strong summer warning rohta fort unesco world heritage site near jhelum monumental testament century muslim military architecture commission formidable pashtun ruler sher shah suri massive wall strategic location essential destination history architecture enthusiast visitor heed crucial piece advice explore grandeur rohta fort experience well save cooler month intense summer heat visit extremely challenging glimpse story past build fort masterpiece strategic design intend suppress local tribe defend return exile mughal emperor humayun architecture fascinating blend afghan persian local tradition create unique style later influence mughal fort sheer scale breathtake fortified sandstone wall stretch kilometer punctuate bastion monumental gate key structure like haveli man singh rani mahal impressive shahi mosque offer glimpse life culture era summer visit recommend summer punjab bring extreme heat fort expose rugged terrain offer little respite explore vast hectare expanse require extensive walking uneven ground strenuous uncomfortable task scorch sun pleasant truly immersive experience plan visit cool forgiving month october march highly recommended plan visit rohta fort open daily pm entry ticket price pkr foreign tourist pkr local visitor give fort vastness consider hire local guide essential wear comfortable walking shoe bring ample supply water snack facility fort limited right season rohta fort magnificent historical site offer captivate journey past grandeur architectural brilliance undeniable fully appreciate splendor essential visit right season ensure comfortable memorable experience nice beautiful ruin old fort tour guide knowledgeable keep entertain fact place lot walk climb stair involve careful golf cart bus service available limited sure water wear clothe straight washer later rohta fort locate outskirt dina city minute drive city center visit fort interest history confidently large impressive fort see massive preserve heavily fortified elderly guide give excellent tour explain history fort build build build fort construct sher shah suri defense mughal invasion architecturally design function fortified city structure show advanced secure century fort historically rich peaceful place ideal contemplation relaxation multiple gate historically link different city interested history site highly recommend thing mind visit young child careful area fort lack protective barrier wall make risky small kid canteen price high suggest bring food especially water visit january winter walk fort exhausting water museum inside fort free enter photography allow inside museum despite minor issue rohta fort fantastic place visit appreciate history heritage

Shumber Waterfalls,"Shumber Waterfalls Waterfall Shumber waterfall is 22 Kms and 45 minutes drive from Islamabad. First, you drive towards Murree Highway and turn left from Shah Dara Road before Bara Kahu and drive towards the Shahdara picnic spot. is half an hour hike from the Shahdara picnic spot. Shumber Waterfall  A Quiet Gem Near Islamabad Tucked away in the Margalla Hills near Shahdara Valley, Shumber Waterfall is one of those lesser-known spots that feels like a quiet escape  especially if you time your visit well. The short drive from Islamabad (roughly 3040 minutes depending on traffic) leads to a dirt trailhead near Hidden Terrace, after which its about a 1520 minute walk to reach the waterfall. The hike itself is relatively manageable  not too steep, with some shaded patches and beautiful greenery all around. The waterfall is seasonal, so its best visited after the monsoon. We went during the monsoon, and the flow of the water was quite strong and steady  definitely added to the experience. However, Id strongly recommend checking the weather forecast before heading out. Monsoon can be unpredictable, and what starts as a fun, relaxing hike could quickly turn risky if you get caught in the rain  especially given the flooding incidents seen in 2025. Best to go on a dry day with clear skies. What stood out was the natural setting  rocky pools, forested trails, and relatively minimal crowding compared to other, more well-known picnic spots. It helped that we started early, around 78AM; the trail was quiet and peaceful on the way in, but we noticed it starting to get crowded on our way back. The water is clear and cool, great for a refreshing dip if youre careful. The rocks can be slippery, so proper shoes are a must. Also, theres no formal infrastructure  no food stalls or restrooms  which adds to the raw feel of the place but means youll need to come prepared. All in all, a rewarding short escape from the city. Go early, go light, and dont forget to carry your trash back. Oh and given how cold the water was in July even, carry a towel to dry off after the dip in the water and spare shirt to avoid catching a cold. Very peaceful and beautiful location. Currently Roads are damaged due to rain but its a patch. Overall good experience. Just short drive approx 5 mintues from shahdra. Roads are perfect. Park the bikes or car.

It is capable of more than 5 stars because We have met Sheikh Rashid who make us to visit whole lal haveli LAL HAVELI ( ) is a historic building in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, known for its striking red facade and political significance. Located near Raja Bazaar, it has served as the residence and political office of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, a prominent Pakistani politician. The Haveli's architecture reflects a blend of Mughal and colonial influences, attracting visitors interested in history and culture. Over the years, it has become a symbol of political activity and public gatherings in the city. Despite modern developments, Lal Haveli retains its historical charm and remains an iconic landmark of Rawalpindi. Lal Haveli, located in the Saddar area of Rawalpindi, is a historical landmark celebrated for its architectural charm and cultural significance. Built during the British Raj, its red brick structure combines Mughal and colonial styles, making it a unique attraction. Over time, it has gained fame as the residence and political headquarters of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, a prominent Pakistani politician. Many admire Lal Haveli for its historical value and its role in preserving Rawalpindi's heritage. Locals and tourists appreciate its old-world charm and accessibility, making it a popular cultural and historical site. The haveli is also a hub for community engagement, hosting religious and cultural events that foster inclusivity and strengthen its connection to the local population. However, its strong political association polarizes opinions. While Sheikh Rashid's supporters see it as a symbol of political resilience and grassroots activism, critics argue that its political use overshadows its historical importance. Controversies over ownership and maintenance issues have further tarnished its image for some. Concerns about preservation are frequent, as parts of the haveli show signs of neglect. Many suggest that restoration efforts and enhanced tourist facilities, such as guided tours and informational displays, could elevate its status as a heritage site. In summary, Lal Haveli is a symbol of Rawalpindis history and culture but needs focused preservation efforts to fully realize its potential as a heritage landmark, independent of its political associations.",lal haveli historical landmark famous politically significant red mansion shah family major landmark heart rawalpindi capable star meet sheikh rashid visit lal haveli lal haveli historic building rawalpindi pakistan know striking red facade political significance locate near raja bazaar serve residence political office sheikh rashid ahmed prominent pakistani politician haveli architecture reflect blend mughal colonial influence attract visitor interested history culture year symbol political activity public gathering city despite modern development lal haveli retain historical charm remain iconic landmark rawalpindi lal haveli locate saddar area rawalpindi historical landmark celebrate architectural charm cultural significance build british raj red brick structure combine mughal colonial style make unique attraction time gain fame residence political headquarters sheikh rashid ahmed prominent pakistani politician admire lal haveli historical value role preserve rawalpindi heritage local tourist appreciate old world charm accessibility make popular cultural historical site haveli hub community engagement host religious cultural event foster inclusivity strengthen connection local population strong political association polarize opinion sheikh rashid supporter symbol political resilience grassroots activism critic argue political use overshadow historical importance controversy ownership maintenance issue tarnish image concern preservation frequent part haveli sign neglect suggest restoration effort enhance tourist facility guide tour informational display elevate status heritage site summary lal haveli symbol rawalpindis history culture need focused preservation effort fully realize potential heritage landmark independent political association

Bohot hee pur sakoon or healthy jaggah hay Very good and peacfull place for a morning walk Very well maintained extremely polite people who manage it Today, I visited the Butterfly House at Jallo Park with my family, expecting a refreshing and educational experience. However, to our great disappointment, we were met with two surprising and unfortunate situations: 1.	There was no electricity at the facility, making the environment extremely uncomfortable for visitors  especially families with young children. 2.	And even more surprisingly  there were no butterflies inside the Butterfly House! When we inquired, the management on duty informed us that they have repeatedly raised this issue with DG PHA office, but unfortunately, no action has been taken so far. As a public attraction promoted for tourism, learning, and recreation, such negligence not only ruins the visitor experience but also reflects poorly on the efforts of the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA). The name Butterfly House loses all meaning if it has no butterflies and lacks even basic facilities like electricity. We sincerely hope that: The butterfly habitat is restored and maintained properly, with butterflies reintroduced. Electricity and basic infrastructure issues are resolved on priority. Visitor feedback and complaints from your on-ground staff are taken seriously and acted upon promptly. We look forward to seeing improvements and a prompt response from your end.

Depalpur Fort,"Depalpur Fort Historical Fort A historical fort located in the town of Depalpur, with significance dating back to the Mughal era. Historical Background of Depalpur Fort. Ancient Origins Depalpur is one of South Asia's oldest continuously inhabited cities, with settlement traces dating back to the Kushan era (circa 40 CE to 172 CE) and perhaps even earlier during the Indo-Scythian period around 100 BCE, as evidenced by archaeological finds . I visited Depalpur Fort, also known as Dhaki, and was sad to see its condition. This old fort, located higher than Depalpur city, is now mostly ruined. Only two gates remain, and they don't look as good as they used to, even after repairs. Walking around the fort, I felt a strong sense of loss. This place was once very important, dating back to the 13th century. Now, people have built homes inside the fort, and there's no proper system for waste and sewage. The area is dirty and neglected. It's heartbreaking to see this historic site in such bad shape. Depalpur Fort is a big part of Pakistan's history and culture. I hope someone takes care of it soon and restores it to its former glory Dera bhuman shah one of ancient tample of Udasi sect of Baba Nankana son shri,Bhuman was the dead follower of Udasi sect.Tample is in good condition but need to care of conservation.",depalpur fort historical fort historical fort locate town depalpur significance date mughal era historical background depalpur fort ancient origin depalpur south asia old continuously inhabit city settlement trace date kushan era circa ce ce early indo scythian period bce evidence archaeological find visit depalpur fort know dhaki sad condition old fort locate high depalpur city ruin gate remain look good repair walk fort feel strong sense loss place important date century people build home inside fort proper system waste sewage area dirty neglect heartbreaking historic site bad shape depalpur fort big pakistan history culture hope take care soon restore glory dera bhuman shah ancient tample udasi sect baba nankana son shri bhuman dead follower udasi good condition need care conservation

The Umer Hayat Mahal is a magnificent example of Mughal and Sikh architectural styles, built in the 19th century. It's a beautiful palace that showcases the rich cultural heritage of Chiniot. The palace was built by Sheikh Umer Hayat, a wealthy merchant of Chiniot, and features intricate wooden carvings, ornate tile work, and stunning architecture. The Umer Hayat Mahal is considered one of the most impressive and well-preserved examples of a traditional Punjabi mansion. It has been beautifully restored and now serves as a museum, showcasing the art, culture, and history of the region. Sheikh Omar Hayat Vohra migrated fromChiniottoCalcuttain the late 19th century after being ostracised for marrying against his family's will.Large numbers of Chiniot's Sheikh tribe had settled in Calcutta during the British era. Sheikh Omar's first son, Gulzar Vohra, was born in 1920, prompting Sheikh Omar's decision to return to his hometown,where he decided to construct a magnificent palace that would feature the best of Chiniot's craftsmanship. Syed Hassan Shah was assigned the task of the mansion's construction. He gathered the best artisans from Chiniot, as well as from other places, who continued working for 10 ten years to complete the structure. Rahim Bakhsh Pirjha and Elahi Bakhsh Pirjha, masters in themanabat karistyle of wood carving, carried out much of the mansion's woodwork.Ahmad Din completed the brickwork, while the celebrated artist Niaz Ahmad Jalandari did the stucco-work.Another celebrated artist, Jan Muhammad, painted the mansion'sfrescoes. The mansion was habitable by 1930, and described as a 'local wonder' by the British authors of theDistrict Gazeteer of Jhang.It was completed in 1935- at a cost of 200,000 rupees.Sheikh Omar died shortly after its completion in 1935. Sheikh Omar Hayat's only son, Gulzar Vohra, was married in the mansion in an extravagant ceremony in 1937.Gulzar was found dead in the palace the very next day of his marriage, possibly due to carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of large volumes of coal that had been burned for the celebration.He was buried in the courtyard of the ground floor of the palace, alongside the grave of his mother Fatima who later passed.

An orphanage was established in 1948 by Sheikh Muhammad Amin, though it was shifted in 1950, leaving the building abandoned once again.Local scavengers dismantled some of the mansion's decorative elements, and sold them to collectors in other cities. Two levels of the mansion was removed in the 1970s due to its state of dangerous disrepair, while another level had to be abandoned following severe rains in 1993.The building was brought under government control in 1989, with large portions repaired by the mid-1990s with funds raised by the local community.The mansion is now used as a cultural centre and library.

Other then google maps you have no option to reach there as there is no board or sign for this historical place. Place has parking space and memorial is walled with Maj Shaheed photo engraved on stone and with history. Behind that is B.R.B Canal in its original form. Monument in memory of Major Raja Aziz Bhatti and his men who fought valiantly against overwhelming odds in the shape of invading Indian hordes. Major Aziz Bhatti had company strength troops and later on another company joined him, but they repulsed attack after attack by Indian forces who attacked in brigade strength using armour, artillery and Infantry. The Pakistani troops led by Aziz Bhatti defended the BRB canal entrenched on the home bank (where this monument is) and foiled Indian attempts to cross the canal and seize the city of Lahore. From 6th September to the 10th, Major Aziz Bhatti fought continously without sleep or rest and repulsed the Indians. Ultimately, while directing artillery fire upon Indian armour, he was targeted by an Indian tank which fired directly at him. The tank shell hit him in the left side of the chest and led to his instantaneous martyrdom on the spot.

F-9 Park, officially known as Fatima Jinnah Park, is unequivocally the green heart of Islamabad and an essential visit for residents and tourists alike. Spanning a vast Areaeffectively an entire sectorit provides a crucial, expansive escape from the citys concrete jungle. Its sheer size means you can genuinely lose yourself in nature, a rare luxury in a modern capital. The parks primary strength lies in its excellent infrastructure for physical activity. The well-maintained, dedicated walking and jogging tracks are fantastic, making it the perfect spot for morning exercise, cycling, or just a leisurely evening stroll. With the picturesque Margalla Hills serving as a backdrop, the environment is both serene and motivational. Beyond the tracks, the park is a hub of varied activities. Theres a large, well-equipped children's play area that keeps families coming back, and open lawns are always filled with people picnicking or playing casual sports. Facilities like the outdoor gym stations and dedicated recreational complex (Leisure Arena/Gandhara Citizen Club) further enhance its utility. I also appreciate the efforts toward sustainability, including the visible solar power plant. While a few sections, particularly near the gates, can get crowded, the parks immense size allows for tranquility in its inner areas, which feel more like a wildlife sanctuary. It's truly a testament to Islamabad's planning and remains free of charge for general entry, making it accessible to everyone.

Changa Manga Forest Park,"Changa Manga Forest Park Forest / Wildlife Park One of the largest man-made forests in the world, featuring a wildlife park, train rides, and picnic spots. Changa Manga is a big man-made forest near Lahore, Pakistan. Its a peaceful place full of trees, birds, and fun activities. Its great for a one-day picnic with family or friends.  What You Can Do There: Mini Train Ride A small train takes you through the jungle. Fun for kids and gives you a nice view of the forest. Boating There is a lake where you can enjoy paddle boating. Very calm and relaxing. Picnic Areas You can sit, eat, and relax under big shady trees. Good place to bring homemade food and enjoy nature. Animals You might see deer, monkeys, and birds. There is a small zoo as well. Walking & Cycling You can walk or ride a bike on the paths in the forest.  Good Things: Quiet and peaceful place Good for kids and families Beautiful nature and fresh air Cheap or free to enter This is a dream like beautiful place, especially when the weather is cloudy. The rope bridge is not only fun but also adds to the esthetic beauty of the place. Now they have reduced the area, still it seems appealing. The admin could do very well but alas! The lake is too muddy, the boats are rotting, the birds have flown away, the trees are quite less, the vendors don't have proper system to sell any goods, the toilets have no doors, and at the entrance it says that camera is watching you but you have to keep an eye on your vehicle in the parking in case it gets stolen. It seems funny yet pathetic. The train timings are not mentioned and it leaves as soon as they think its full. No written instructions how much time it takes to complete a circle, but it is mentioned that you pay 100 rs per person till 1 corner to the other (then to return to the 1st corner from where you sat there is probably another 100 rs. per person, but we couldn't take the previlege to get a ride) we kept waiting for the train to get back on its station but there was nobody to tell how much wait was required. So after 20 min we left that place. The tram outside has no fee structure, that person said 1000 rs for a family, but a family could be 10 people or more, or less, but he couldn't justify. In short it can be made the most beautiful place by little bit of care but nobody cares. Even the public doesn't care to take away its litter after enjoying the food. There are cats in scarcity and no squirrels at all, which is the biggest flaw. It proves that there is no place for animals and birds to live in the forest. We should be so loving that birds get back there, that squirrels get abundant, that bees make hives, that butterflies dance in distance and make our young children aware how a forest looks. I wish someone local, who can, reads this all and brings improvement. Review: A Wonderful Visit to Changa Manga, Lahore Our recent visit to Changa Manga, located near Lahore, was an incredible experience filled with fun and relaxation. Known as one of the largest man-made forests in the world, this place offers a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. From the moment we arrived, we were amazed by the lush greenery and the serene environment. The fresh air and scenic beauty made it a perfect spot for a picnic. We enjoyed walking through the forest trails, surrounded by towering trees and chirping birds, creating a peaceful atmosphere. One of the highlights of our visit was the famous Changa Manga train ride, which took us on a delightful journey through the forest. The boating area was another exciting experience, where we enjoyed paddling in the calm waters. The small zoo inside the park was a great attraction, especially for children. The park also has well-maintained picnic areas and food stalls, making it easy to relax and enjoy a meal with family and friends. The management has done a good job in keeping the place clean and safe for visitors. Overall, we had a fantastic time at Changa Manga.

Mori Gate,"Mori Gate Historical Landmark One of the historic gates of the Walled City of Lahore, leading into a bustling bazaar. Mori Gate  Walled City of Lahore Address: Qadimi Shehar, Inside Mori Gate, near Urdu Bazar, Kucha Baili Ram, Walled City of Lahore, Lahore, 54000 Mori Gate is one of the twelve historic gates of the old Walled City of Lahore  a humble yet deeply significant passage into centuries of history, trade, and tradition. Unlike the grander gates such as Delhi Gate or Bhati Gate, Mori Gate carries a quieter charm, representing the daily life and resilience of old Lahore. Its narrow streets open into vibrant bazaars, small shops, and the timeless rhythm of city life that continues much as it did hundreds of years ago. This area is especially known for its proximity to Urdu Bazar  the literary heart of Lahore  where booksellers, writers, and students fill the lanes with words and wisdom. Walking through Mori Gate, one feels the living pulse of Lahore: the aroma of desi food, the sound of conversation, the colors of old architecture blending with the simplicity of modern life. Though smaller in size, Mori Gate holds a large piece of the citys soul. It tells the story of ordinary people whose lives built the extraordinary spirit of Lahore  a city that has seen empires fall, cultures blend, and love endure through time.  Here, the past walks beside you  quietly, yet proudly. Mori Gate, nestled within Lahores historic Walled City, holds a unique position among the citys ancient gateways. Unlike the grand entrances like Delhi or Bhati Gates, Mori Gate was a modest openingits name Mori meaning small hole in Urdu. Historically, it served dual purposes: providing access to the city after the main gates were closed at dusk and acting as an outlet for the citys refuse.    Though not officially recognized as one of the original twelve gates, locals have long considered Mori Gate the unofficial 13th. Over time, the original structure was demolished during British colonial rule, leaving no physical remnants. Today, the area thrives as Lahores largest fish market and is also renowned for its surgical goods market, the most extensive in the city.    The vicinity of Mori Gate is rich in cultural and historical significance. Nearby lies the Haveli of Nau Nihal Singh, a splendid example of Sikh-era architecture that has been repurposed as a girls school. The area is also known for producing high-quality lakh, a traditional furniture polish, and boasts a vibrant kite market, especially lively during the Basant festival.   Just because Mori Gate was the smallest of the 13 gates, it was assumed as being a garbage disposal point. For people who live in the walled city, or once lived there, this is a bizarre insult of sorts. So let me narrate a few facts as they can be seen even today. First we must understand that the original walled city had just two gateways to the south, they being Lohari and Mori. To the west there were none, except when the wall that ran along to the east of todays Bazaar Hakeeman, it turned inward and then there were three gateways, them being Taxali, Khizri and Kashmiri. These three were located along the current Chowk Taxali that meets Rang Mahal at the mound top turning towards Shahalami Bazaar. In the middle of this old western side in the middle along the mound was the original Delhi Gate. Traces of it still exist. Now comes the important assumption. Lahore is built on high mounds and to the west they flatten out. Around the fort and the city the River Ravi flowed turning in near the fort and going around the city and heading southwards from after Mori Gate near where today is built Bhati Gate. Almost 150 to 200 yards away from all these original seven gateways, as also away from the present 13 gateways, a waste water outlet exists. It still has the old iron grills to prevent anyone slipping in. These dropped into the river the encircled the walls. When Akbar expanded the city, primarily to accommodate the fierce Rajput Bhat warriors, who use the surname Bhatti, to the west and to the east the Turkic-Qizilbash horsemen in todays Mochi Gate area, we see that the southern portion remained the same and the northern was pushed outwards to cater for the growing importance of a river port. This was originally called Khizri Gate and Ranjit Singh renamed it Sheranwala. Akbars wife Maryam Zamani built a mosque just opposite the forts Akbari Gate and was called Masjidi Gate, now called Masti Gate. Maryam Zamani herself built some massive ships to ply Hajis. To one side of each gateway ran that particular areas waste waterway. So it was with Mori Gate. Inside Mori Gate was a huge garden in which people collected to pray before Hindu corpses were taken outside to be cremated at the point where the river turned to the south. This is the place where also the great Lahore Hindushahi Rajput ruler Raja Jayapala committed Johar after being defeated by the Afghan invader Mahmud. So to assume that at such a holy point is a waste disposal area is not to understand the social history, let alone the geography, of Lahore.",mori gate historical landmark historic gate walled city lahore lead bustling bazaar mori gate walled city lahore address qadimi shehar inside mori gate near urdu bazar kucha baili ram walled city lahore lahore mori gate historic gate old walled city lahore humble deeply significant passage century history trade tradition unlike grander gate delhi gate bhati gate mori gate carry quieter charm represent daily life resilience old lahore narrow street open vibrant bazaar small shop timeless rhythm city life continue hundred year ago area especially know proximity urdu bazar literary heart lahore bookseller writer student fill lane word wisdom walk mori gate feel live pulse lahore aroma desi food sound conversation color old architecture blend simplicity modern life small size mori gate hold large piece citys soul tell story ordinary people life build extraordinary spirit lahore city see empire fall culture blend love endure time past walk quietly proudly mori gate nestle lahore historic walled city hold unique position city ancient gateway unlike grand entrance like delhi bhati gate mori gate modest openingit mori mean small hole urdu historically serve dual purpose provide access city main gate close dusk act outlet citys refuse officially recognize original gate local long consider mori gate unofficial time original structure demolish british colonial rule leave physical remnant today area thrive lahore large fish market renowned surgical good market extensive city vicinity mori gate rich cultural historical significance nearby lie haveli nau nihal singh splendid example sikh era architecture repurpose girls school area know produce high quality lakh traditional furniture polish boast vibrant kite market especially lively basant festival mori gate small gate assume garbage disposal point people live walled city live bizarre insult sort let narrate fact see today understand original walled city gateway south lohari mori west wall run east todays bazaar hakeeman turn inward gateway taxali khizri kashmiri locate current chowk taxali meet rang mahal mound turning shahalami bazaar middle old western middle mound original delhi gate trace exist come important assumption lahore build high mound west flatten fort city river ravi flow turn near fort go city head southward mori gate near today build bhati gate yard away original seven gateway away present gateway waste water outlet exist old iron grill prevent slip drop river encircled wall akbar expand city primarily accommodate fierce rajput bhat warrior use surname bhatti west east turkic qizilbash horsemen todays mochi gate area southern portion remain northern push outward cater grow importance river port originally call khizri gate ranjit singh rename sheranwala akbar wife maryam zamani build mosque opposite fort akbari gate call masjidi gate call masti gate maryam zamani build massive ship ply haji gateway run particular area waste waterway mori gate inside mori gate huge garden people collect pray hindu corpse take outside cremate point river turn south place great lahore hindushahi rajput ruler raja jayapala commit johar defeat afghan invader mahmud assume holy point waste disposal area understand social history let geography lahore

So, on the day 1 of Eid UL Fitr I alongside my family visited this park. Let me share some recent photos... The place is really nice for those who yearn for some wilderness but the department of Wild life is in a shambles and looks impoverished. It appears the birds and animals are not getting the care they deserve. They have two places actually disconnected from each other by wild growth that the department is unable to clear. The road from Islamabad Expressway is in really poor shape and if you wanna go there in your car you might find it challenging. The part where they keep the lions is too close to the Korang Nullah and smells really awful. This wildlife park is poorly managed. Although it covers a big area and green grassy fields but everything shows lack of interest from relevant authorities. Birds' cages are old and need maintenance, grassy grounds need regular trimming and care, and the park staff needs to be trained.",loi bher safari park wildlife park safari park safari park wildlife sanctuary outskirt rawalpindi islamabad serene pleasant place visit find solace recommend family visit place friend suggest visit park locate day eid ul fitr alongside family visit park let share recent photo place nice yearn wilderness department wild life shamble look impoverished appear bird animal get care deserve place actually disconnect wild growth department unable clear road islamabad expressway poor shape wanna car find challenge lion close korang nullah smell awful wildlife park poorly manage cover big area green grassy field show lack interest relevant authority bird cage old need maintenance grassy ground need regular trimming care park staff need train
"Quaid-i-Azam Residency, Ziarat","Quaid-i-Azam Residency, Ziarat Museum / National Monument The historic summer residence where Muhammad Ali Jinnah spent his last days; a national monument. Its National Heritage site and worth a visit. There is Huge car park and not very crowded especially in winters as it was very cold. Most of the rooms were closed but after requesting the keeper can be seen. Very nice place and a must see place. Huge Juniper trees and big lawns looks very beautiful. There is a lunch break from 12 to 2 pm, rest from 9 am to 5 pm the place is open. The ticket is also very nominal with a very reasonable car parking fee. Quaid-e-Azam Residency in Ziarat offers a captivating experience with its beautiful surroundings and historical significance. The architecture of the residency is truly remarkable, reflecting a blend of colonial and local styles. The scenic views from the site are breathtaking, providing a serene atmosphere for visitors. However, it's essential to note that the maintenance, particularly the cleanliness of the washroom facilities, is lacking. During my visit, I encountered an issue with the unclean washrooms, and I learned that there had been a prolonged water shortage for months, which significantly impacted the overall visitor experience. It's crucial for the management to address these concerns to ensure that the historical site remains enjoyable for all visitors. A very beautiful place in Ziarat. If you are visiting Quetta you have to go to ziarat and visit Quaid e Azam residency. You will adventure roads and other places which may come on the way. And you loved also to see them.

Lahore Wildlife Park,"Lahore Wildlife Park Wildlife Park A wildlife park and zoo in Lahore, home to various animal species and a popular family destination. Love the whole concept, one of it's kind in Pakistan as far I know, properly managed with lots of upcoming amenities. A complete family fun package which all the age group evenly enjoy. Ticket price is justified with the services offered. Keep it up  I had a good experience visiting Safari Park. The environment is pleasant, and its a nice place to spend time with family or friends. However, theres a bit of a shortage when it comes to the variety of animals. For example, lions are limited, and some animals like rhinos are missing altogether. Still, its worth visiting for the overall atmosphere and the animals that are there. I have visited today and really disappointed. Its like they are just need a money from us and they tricked us just like govt does. Parking fee Rs.100 means something as it was built for safe parking. Then after entering there is 100Rs per person and literally thats just for entry and sitting on a green grass to feel the heat of sun. Then if we want to see range of animals (only deer family and few ostriches) were for Rs.300/person, only thing that was fascinated a little is aquarium where few different fishes to experience and a good time there and that was i think Rs.200/person. Then the last and pathetic phase was lion safari, they take people in a cage for 300/person with no space to stand and enjoy. They almost got into fight with me that we (family) has to enter in a car with another family or two as they can't afford to take single family in a car. Anyways they took us and we were thrilled to see lions/tigers then there was surprisingly a suprise that there was only single point where they had to take us and there was only 1-lion and 4-lioness. And for just 100-meter drive they were taking 300/person and asking for 4500 if to book for single family. Pathetic and above all these their greeting persons showed worst behaviour and when i made a call on complaint center there was also a person that responded just as an illiterate one. That looks like my last visit and will not recommend people if they want to see animals and lions as nothing there. Bad Customer Service/ Govt. Officer like attitude as if we argue they can shoot us without any hesitation/charging for just wishing to visit the wild life park that we visited few years back but now its like just DEER park.

Bukkur Fort,"Bukkur Fort Historical Fort A historical fort located on an island in the Indus River near Rohri. Great but Bukkar fort walls need to be rebuilt at many places,as it's a sand and soil ,tie with lime stone,marble pieces and utensils pieces and local rocks bounded by Small bricks, so if rain,land sliding is too quick at places where historical wall is broken. Nothing special inside Fort now, except a view points.beautiful views and Great climate. Please post your photographs of Bukkur (Bakhar) Fort. I am a specialist in medieval Islamic cartography and I believe that this is a really important site. I would like to see more pictures. It needs expert archaeological work and definitely that fort needs to be restored. It is a small island in River Indus located between the towns of Sukkur and Rohri. The island, which is irregular in shape, is about 2 furlong broad in the North-South directions and 4 furlong long in the East-West directions. The entire island falls within the Fort as the fortification wall runs on the outer periphery of the island, touching the Indus water around. The western portion is inhabited and has backs and parade ground devoid of any monument except for a shrine and ruined mosque, but there are indications that this part once contained many buildings, etc. as the whole area is littered with brick-bats, pottery shreds, and heaps of earth collected over, collapsed structures. The fortification wall, which used to go around the entire island, has disappeared except for a few portions here and there and on the southern and north-western side. It is made from burnt brick tiles of 12x12x21 size, though there are many different sizes of bricks that have been used in it, probably for repair purposes. A number of bastions of semi-circular and elliptical shapes are still standing there. Also, along with them can be seen gate-ways of different sizes that are now looked with rubble. The fortification wall is about 5 thick, but at places, it reduces to only 2 but at places, it is only 10 high. The railway line divides this into two equal parts. The western part has only two buildings, one modern shrine or tomb, and the other is a mosque built of burnt bricks in mud. The eastern part, however, only contains foundations of walls here and there.

It stands symbol for the colonial times and it is still used for its original purpose: a market. You will find spices, fruits and veggies, household items, meat. Empress Market in Saddar, Karachi, is more than just a market; it's a living piece of history. The grand, colonial-era building with its distinctive clock tower still stands proudly, a testament to its British Raj origins. While it has undergone significant changes in recent years, particularly with the removal of encroachments, its bustling spirit remains. Today, Empress Market is primarily a hub for wholesale and retail of fresh produce  fruits, vegetables, meat, and a dazzling array of spices that awaken the senses. You'll find vendors specializing in everything from exotic dry fruits to everyday condiments. It's a fantastic place to experience the raw, vibrant energy of Karachi's local commerce, with the constant chatter of vendors and the lively crowd. Though some of the informal stalls that once spilled out onto the streets are gone, the market continues to be an essential part of Karachi's daily life, offering competitive prices and a vast selection. It's a truly authentic Karachi experience, a place where history and commerce intertwine. Be prepared for a sensory overload in the best possible way! A Historic Landmark That Needs Better Maintenance Empress Market is one of Karachis most iconic landmarks, steeped in colonial history and bustling with activity. Built between 1884 and 1889, the market was constructed to commemorate Queen Victoria, the Empress of India, during British rule. However, its location has a deeper historical significancethis was the site where Mangal Pandey, along with other Indian soldiers, was reportedly executed after the 1857 War of Independence. Today, Empress Market remains a vital commercial hub, offering everything from spices and dry fruits to household goods. Walking through its grand arched entrance, you can still see remnants of its original British-era architecture, a reminder of its historical past. However, the market is now overcrowded, and while the variety of goods available is impressive, the overall cleanliness leaves much to be desired. The markets historic charm is overshadowed by litter, poor waste management, and encroachments. To truly restore Empress Markets former grandeur, there is an urgent need for better cleanliness and maintenance. Additionally, more greenery around the market would complement its historical aesthetics, making it a more pleasant space for visitors. Proper restoration efforts, along with stricter waste management policies, could transform this site into not just a shopping destination but also a well-preserved historical attraction. Despite these shortcomings, Empress Market remains a must-visit for those who appreciate Karachis rich history and vibrant street culture. A little more care and restoration could elevate it to a five-star landmark.",empress market historical market large historic victorian era market karachi know architecture diverse good visit go karachi stand symbol colonial time original purpose market find spice fruit veggie household item meat empress market saddar karachi market live piece history grand colonial era building distinctive clock tower stand proudly testament british raj origin undergo significant change recent year particularly removal encroachment bustling spirit remain today empress market primarily hub wholesale retail fresh produce fruit vegetable meat dazzling array spice awaken sense find vendor specialize exotic dry fruit everyday condiment fantastic place experience raw vibrant energy karachi local commerce constant chatter vendor lively crowd informal stall spill street go market continue essential karachi daily life offer competitive price vast selection truly authentic karachi experience place history commerce intertwine prepare sensory overload good possible way historic landmark need well maintenance empress market karachis iconic landmark steep colonial history bustle activity build market construct commemorate queen victoria empress india british rule location deep historical significancethis site mangal pandey indian soldier reportedly execute war independence today empress market remain vital commercial hub offer spice dry fruit household good walk grand arched entrance remnant original british era architecture reminder historical past market overcrowded variety good available impressive overall cleanliness leave desire market historic charm overshadow litter poor waste management encroachment truly restore empress market grandeur urgent need well cleanliness maintenance additionally greenery market complement historical aesthetic make pleasant space visitor proper restoration effort strict waste management policy transform site shopping destination preserve historical attraction despite shortcoming empress market remain visit appreciate karachis rich history vibrant street culture little care restoration elevate star landmark

Jhukar are situated on the right side of the road just opposite the Allied Textile Mills. The mounds at Jhukar of great Archaeological and Historical importance, which have yielded remains from the period of Moenjodaro down to the 5th Century A.D. These mounds however, are not so extensive as Mohenjodaro. In Union Council mithodero, of Larkana district, about 2 mile west of the larkana karachi indus Highway, N55, there is a Daro called jhokar jo daro. Jhukar historical mounds On Google maps, it lies almost at the centre of the beige swathe of nothingness between the Highway and the Indus Highway. Relegated to non-existence on Google, the village is made up of approximately 60 homes. Its residents, the only route leading to the village is a mud track along a canal bank. There are many such remote settlements in the taluka. However, there is something unique about this one. Right beside the village is a vast mound that covers more than twice the surface area of the settlement itself. The Sindhi word for mound is daro and this gives the settlement its name  jhokar jo daro; the Mound of the jhukar in the same manner as the daro in Mohenjo-Daro. The mound is about a mile in length, half a mile in width at one end and less than a quarter mile in width at the other end. With gradual ease, it rises to a height of approximately 30 feet. Locals are of the view that the mound may have been created by the debris of a village that stood here in the not-so-distant past. Although it is near impossible to locate records on past settlements in the area, the notion is questionable. Other sites of abandoned villages have no mounds in their midst. Some villages are built on high ground so as to provide protection from flooding, but Daro Labara is not located on the mound so much as at the foot of it. For such a mound to be created by the debris of a recent village, the village would have had to have unusually high buildings.....

The site of Lakhanjo-Daro, located beneath modern Sukkur, Pakistan is one of the most important urban centers of the Indus Civilization and yet it has not been properly studied due to its location under a modern city that is rapidly expanding. This site was first discovered in 1985 and small-scale excavations and surveys were carried out by the faculty and students of Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur (Kazi 1985). Larger scale excavations were carried out by the same department in 2006 and then again during 2009/10 (Shaikh et al 2006, Mallah et al 2012). Due to various factors, it has not been possible to carry out more intensive horizontal excavations or long-term research on any single part of the site. Nevertheless, based on excavations in three different areas, two locations in the central mound and one in the western mound, it is clear that the ancient settlement of Lakhanjo-Daro is extremely large and spread over a vast area. Furthermore the artifacts recovered from the excavations, such as pottery, inscribed seals and figurines, are very similar to those found at other major cities of the Indus Valley region.

Katora Lake (Kumrat),"Katora Lake (Kumrat) Alpine Lake A high-altitude lake in the Kumrat Valley, shaped like a bowl (""katora""). My journey to Katora Lake began from the beautiful Jahazbanda meadows. The trek was not easy, but the destination was worth every step. When I finally reached, the sight of the turquoise-blue lake left me speechless. The lake is surrounded by majestic peaks, adding to its charm. Boats are also available here, letting you sail and enjoy the calm waters. Katora Lake is truly a hidden paradise in the mountains. Katora Lake Pakistan Katora Lake Height (11,500 feet/3,500 m from Sea level) Kumrat Valley is a high frosty lake situated at the upper ranges of Jahaz Banda. The region of the Upper Dir District of KPK. Due to this, you will witness the crystal clear greenish climate of the lake. The word Katora signifies bowl in Pashto (bowl-shaped). Mostly people think about the Katora Lake hike in Pakistan. First of all, a 4 to 5-hour trek from Thal village to Jahaz Banda. After all, trekkers stay at camps under the billion stars of Jahaz Banda Meadows. The very next day, a 3 to 4-hour trek to the Lake one-sided. How to Reach Katora Lake: So just returned from one of the most hectic trips ever (mainly due to time shortage) I thought why not right some wrongs one might face while traveling there?Our target was to attempt the Katora Lake trek, Jahaz Banda, and its vicinity and after that explore the ever-beautiful Kumrat valley.  It takes you about 7 hrs. to reach near Upper Dir so if you have left it late your first stop should be in Upper Dir. (you can easily find hotels there for a reasonable night stay around 2000-3000).  Moreover, From Dir one must go back about 8.8Km precisely where you could find Bab-e-Kumrat which would take you to Sheringal Town. (approx. travelling time 3:00 hrs.) The road is in relatively good condition however there are a few bad patches though.  In Addition, From Sheringal it would take around 3-4 hrs. depending on the condition of your vehicle to reach Thal (a kind of base camp for everything in that valley). Road condition is also okay here.  From Thal one can hire Jeeps to do either Jahaz Banda or Kumrat Valley. It is advisable to leave your vehicles in Thal. Jeeps Fare from Thal to Jahaz Banda Lake: Thal Jeeps or 44 vehicles can take you to the highest point Taki Top from where the actual trek for Jahaz Banda starts. The jeeps fare or charges from Thal to Taki Top Jahaz Banda Meadows and back to Thal range between Rs.10000 to Rs.12000 with 1 or 2-night stays at Jahaz Banda.

Otherwise hike is of moderate level. Elder ones find it difficult still. Roads are operational and in good condition. We parked the car in the parking area. Place is so beautiful. It is underrated so I will recommend everyone to go there, have picnic with your loved ones and appreciate the serene beauty of this place. The place is good but there is a lot of trash thrown by the visitors and the local vendors. The horse's owners have made a number of tracks and horses dung have made the track/place smelly smelly.

Elevations range from 3,280m at Kishmanjah village to 4,304m at Karamber Lake in northeast. The terrain is undulating, with steep mountains, wide stretch grassy plains and narrow valleys.

The park offers about 7 different trails. All of which are worth trekking through. Trail 5 is the most well maintained with proper markings throughout the trail. I also recommend trail 3 and new one, trail 7. Before travelling, you may need to confirm if they are open or not, as a local I know that trail 6 has been close for quite some time now to protect wildlife whereas trail 5 was also closed for a week in August 2025. There are different rock climbing spots across the parks, most famous of which is Beetle's nest located behind Saidpur Village. Then, there's different camping spots in the parks, most common of which is trail 5 camping spot. Furthermore, there are some historical spots in the Margilla hills as well, such as Shah Allah Dita caves. Overall, The whole park cannot really be visited in just a day. My recommendation is to stay at least a week in nearby Islamabad and explore it. To be fair, I have been living in Islamabad for 10+ years and I have not really been able to explore all of it so It is justifiable. There are many other spots that I have visited in the park, which are not really mapped on Google Maps, such as the plane crash site in margilla hills Really enjoyed Margalla Hills National Park, the environment, the trail, the water flowing down, the view from top, the species there and many more were fantastic and beyond my expectations. If you wanna go hiking and want some adventure, Margalla Hills is one of the best choices you can make. The Margalla Hills, located in Islamabad, Pakistan, are a stunning range of hills known for their breathtaking natural beauty and diverse wildlife. The area is home to wide, well-paved roads that wind gracefully through lush green mountains and dense clusters of tall, majestic trees. These scenic routes offer a peaceful and refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.",margalla hills national park national park national park near islamabad include trail picnic spot viewpoint like daman e koh pir sohawa margilla hills national park maintain national park pakistan probably easily accessible flaura fauna park breathtaking wildfire occur year park safe get national park close city datum signal appear time time easy help animal encounter common dangerous park offer different trail worth trek trail maintain proper marking trail recommend trail new trail travel need confirm open local know trail close time protect wildlife trail close week august different rock climbing spot park famous beetle nest locate saidpur village different camping spot park common trail camping spot furthermore historical spot margilla hill shah allah dita cave overall park visit day recommendation stay week nearby islamabad explore fair live islamabad year able explore justifiable spot visit park map google map plane crash site margilla hill enjoy margalla hills national park environment trail water flow view specie fantastic expectation wanna hike want adventure margalla hills good choice margalla hills locate islamabad pakistan stunning range hill know breathtaking natural beauty diverse wildlife area home wide pave road wind gracefully lush green mountain dense cluster tall majestic tree scenic route offer peaceful refreshing escape hustle bustle city life

These tombs date back to the 15th to 18th centuries and are primarily associated with the Jokhio tribe, as well as Baloch chieftains. The site is renowned for its sandstone architecture and intricately carved graves, which showcase a unique blend of Islamic, Rajput, and Mughal artistic influences. The tombs are built in a step-pyramid style, often in family enclosures, and feature detailed engravings of weapons, horses, jewelry, floral patterns, and geometric motifs  each symbol reflecting the status, profession, or achievements of the deceased. Although the graves follow Islamic burial customs, the artistry reflects a cross-cultural heritage, making the site both architecturally and historically significant. Recognized for its cultural value, the Chaukhandi Tombs have been placed on the UNESCO Tentative List, though the site remains under threat from weathering and neglect. This site stands as a silent yet powerful reminder of Sindhs layered history and craftsmanship, echoing the stories of warriors, tribes, and the artistic soul of an era long gone.

Hussaini Suspension Bridge,"Hussaini Suspension Bridge Suspension Bridge / Scenic Landmark A famous rickety suspension bridge over the Hunza River in Upper Hunza, known for its dramatic views and risk factor. A Thrilling Experience at Hussaini Suspension Bridge! Id seen the Hussaini Suspension Bridge countless times on YouTube, but nothing compares to seeing it in personits absolutely awesome. That first moment stepping onto the bridge was unforgettable. If youve got a fear of heights, this is definitely not the place for you. Crossing the bridge was both frightening and thrilling. It feels like the whole thing is moving, but its actually the water rushing beneath that messes with your senses. Just focus on the wooden planks and not the water. It took us around 30 to 40 minutes to get across one sideevery step required real nerves of steel. They do give you life jackets before crossing, which might sound reassuring at first. But we were bluntly told they wouldnt save usthe shock of falling into that freezing glacial water would likely be fatal. That definitely added to the intensity of the whole experience. Getting to the bridge isnt exactly easy either. Its a steep uphill climb with a lot of steps, so you need to be in decent shape. But once you're up there, the views are stunning and the adventure is totally worth it. And to top it all offwe zip-wired back across! It was the perfect adrenaline rush to end the journey. If youre ever in the area and looking for something unforgettable, this is one place you must experience. Hussaini Suspension Bridge in Hunza Valley is a unique and adventurous experience. Located over the Indus River in Hussaini Village, the journey starts by passing through the village itself, giving you a close look at local culture, lifestyle, and livelihood. Entry ticket is just Rs. 100, but its important to note that kids are not allowed to go far on the bridge due to safety concernsits genuinely dangerous and not for the faint-hearted. Theres also a zip line available at the site. However, during our visit, we saw someone get stuck midway while returning, which was enough for us to decide against trying it. One key thing to keep in mind is the extremely steep path on the way back. If you have difficulty walking on such inclines, its better to skip the hike. Carrying a water bottle is strongly recommended. The locals are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Most of the shops around the area are run by women, and their prices are surprisingly economical. I would sincerely encourage everyone to support them by purchasing somethingyou wont find such rates anywhere else. All in all, it was a wonderful and memorable experience. A must-try for anyone visiting Hunza Valley. One of the most beautiful suspension bridges I have ever been to. It's an adventurous place when you walk through the bridge you can get motion sickness you will feel like bridge is going away with water",hussaini suspension bridge suspension bridge scenic landmark famous rickety suspension bridge hunza river upper hunza know dramatic view risk factor thrilling experience hussaini suspension bridge d see hussaini suspension bridge countless time youtube compare see personit absolutely awesome moment step bridge unforgettable ve get fear height definitely place cross bridge frightening thrilling feel like thing move actually water rush beneath mess sense focus wooden plank water take minute sideevery step require real nerve steel life jacket crossing sound reassure bluntly tell not save usthe shock fall freeze glacial water likely fatal definitely add intensity experience get bridge not exactly easy steep uphill climb lot step need decent shape view stunning adventure totally worth offwe zip wire perfect adrenaline rush end journey area look unforgettable place experience hussaini suspension bridge hunza valley unique adventurous experience locate indus river hussaini village journey start pass village give close look local culture lifestyle livelihood entry ticket rs important note kid allow far bridge safety concernsit genuinely dangerous faint hearted s zip line available site visit see stuck midway return decide try key thing mind extremely steep path way difficulty walk incline well skip hike carry water bottle strongly recommend local incredibly friendly welcoming shop area run woman price surprisingly economical sincerely encourage support purchase somethingyou will not find rate wonderful memorable experience try visit hunza valley beautiful suspension bridge adventurous place walk bridge motion sickness feel like bridge go away water

My advise to those visiting Deosai, bargain with the car rentals in clear way that you want to gi till Sheosar Lake, they will tell you the charges accordingly (july 2025 Prado Tx till Sheosar with fuel charges are 20k-25k). Leave early morning maximum till 8am no further than that. Reach deosai and do not stop at any point unless any emergency like using the restrooms that you will find at all camps. Reach Bara Pani that takes around hours from Skardu, its the best and only point to have lunch as other camps do not offer lunch, just fries and pakoras and tea. Leave Bara pani after lunch and reach Sheosar lake that will take further 1 and half hour from Bara pani. Stay at Sheosar lake for an hour and then leave back. On the way back you can stop for a moment at Kala pani and then stop again at Chota pani to enjoy evening tea with awesome pakoras and fries with awesome views. Reach back Skardu till 7 or 7:30 pm.

Sheosar Lake,"Sheosar Lake Lake A high-altitude lake on the Deosai Plateau, outstanding plateau scenery. Beautiful place large meadows on high altitude, Deosai National Park. Breathtaking landscape after a 4 hour adventurous drive from Skardu! Most of the tourists visit deosai till chota pani only, some visit the next point Bara Pani, some go further to Kaala Pani, but most of the tourists miss the best point that comes after Kala pani, i-e the beautiful Sheosar lake. My advise to those visiting Deosai, bargain with the car rentals in clear way that you want to gi till Sheosar Lake, they will tell you the charges accordingly (july 2025 Prado Tx till Sheosar with fuel charges are 20k-25k). Leave early morning maximum till 8am no further than that. Reach deosai and do not stop at any point unless any emergency like using the restrooms that you will find at all camps. Reach Bara Pani that takes around hours from Skardu, its the best and only point to have lunch as other camps do not offer lunch, just fries and pakoras and tea. Leave Bara pani after lunch and reach Sheosar lake that will take further 1 and half hour from Bara pani. Stay at Sheosar lake for an hour and then leave back. On the way back you can stop for a moment at Kala pani and then stop again at Chota pani to enjoy evening tea with awesome pakoras and fries with awesome views. Reach back Skardu till 7 or 7:30 pm. A natural marvel. Coming from chillam choki into Deosai National Park. When you finally take the turn towards the lake; the first look, you get awestruck.

Hussaini Suspension Bridge (Upper Hunza),"Hussaini Suspension Bridge (Upper Hunza) Suspension Bridge / Landmark Famous (rickety) suspension bridge across Hunza River near Hussaini. A Thrilling Experience at Hussaini Suspension Bridge! Id seen the Hussaini Suspension Bridge countless times on YouTube, but nothing compares to seeing it in personits absolutely awesome. That first moment stepping onto the bridge was unforgettable. If youve got a fear of heights, this is definitely not the place for you. Crossing the bridge was both frightening and thrilling. It feels like the whole thing is moving, but its actually the water rushing beneath that messes with your senses. Just focus on the wooden planks and not the water. It took us around 30 to 40 minutes to get across one sideevery step required real nerves of steel. They do give you life jackets before crossing, which might sound reassuring at first. But we were bluntly told they wouldnt save usthe shock of falling into that freezing glacial water would likely be fatal. That definitely added to the intensity of the whole experience. Getting to the bridge isnt exactly easy either. Its a steep uphill climb with a lot of steps, so you need to be in decent shape. But once you're up there, the views are stunning and the adventure is totally worth it. And to top it all offwe zip-wired back across! It was the perfect adrenaline rush to end the journey. If youre ever in the area and looking for something unforgettable, this is one place you must experience. Hussaini Suspension Bridge in Hunza Valley is a unique and adventurous experience. Located over the Indus River in Hussaini Village, the journey starts by passing through the village itself, giving you a close look at local culture, lifestyle, and livelihood. Entry ticket is just Rs. 100, but its important to note that kids are not allowed to go far on the bridge due to safety concernsits genuinely dangerous and not for the faint-hearted. Theres also a zip line available at the site. However, during our visit, we saw someone get stuck midway while returning, which was enough for us to decide against trying it. One key thing to keep in mind is the extremely steep path on the way back. If you have difficulty walking on such inclines, its better to skip the hike. Carrying a water bottle is strongly recommended. The locals are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Most of the shops around the area are run by women, and their prices are surprisingly economical. I would sincerely encourage everyone to support them by purchasing somethingyou wont find such rates anywhere else. All in all, it was a wonderful and memorable experience. A must-try for anyone visiting Hunza Valley. One of the most beautiful suspension bridges I have ever been to.

Ranikot Fort,"Ranikot Fort Historical Fort Enormous fortification known as the Great Wall of Sindh (huge circumference). Ranikot Fort, often referred to as the ""Great Wall of Sindh,"" is one of the largest forts in the world, located in the Jamshoro District of Sindh, Pakistan. Spanning nearly 30 kilometers, its massive stone walls stretch across the rugged hills of the Kirthar range, creating a breathtaking sight. Though its origins remain unclear, it is believed to have been reconstructed in the early 19th century by the Talpur dynasty. Inside the outer wall are smaller forts like Mirikot and Shergarh, offering dramatic views and ancient architecture. The fort is popular among adventurers, photographers, and history lovers for its unique structure and natural beauty. Ideal for hiking, stargazing, and exploration, Ranikot is a hidden gem in Pakistan's heritage that offers a powerful blend of mystery and landscape. Rani Kot Fort, situated in Sindh Province, Pakistan, is the largest fort in the world, covering an impressive area of 32 square kilometers. Known as the ""Wall of Pakistan"" or the ""Wall of Sindh,"" this historic site offers a blend of architectural grandeur and adventure. Visitors should make proper preparations before heading to the fort, as there is no continuous electricity supply. The Sindh government operates a guest house within the main fort, managed by the Aukaf department, guest house offers rooms with attached washroom but reservations and references must be arranged in advance and need to have your own dried food as well as backup or consultation with staff. Road conditions leading to the fort require a vehicle with good ground clearance. An overnight stay at Rani Kot is highly recommended for its serene environment and breathtaking stargazing opportunities. For an optimal experience, avoid visiting on nights with a visible moon to enjoy clearer skies. Bring mosquito repellent to ensure a comfortable stay.

So many old, beautifully carved tombs and monuments everywhere, some dating back hundreds of years. Walking around you can really feel the history and the effort that went into all this work.

A must-see for nature lovers and adventure seekers traveling from Karachi. In mid-June, we decided to visit Kund Malir and then headed to the Princess of Hope, as we had heard a lot about it. However, June is a very warm month, making it difficult to step out of the vehicle for long. There were no canteens or cafeterias in sight, but there is a proper staircase leading up the hill. I didnt go because of the heat. Instead, I stayed with a friend inside the vehicle while the others went up. When I looked at the Princess of Hope and the surrounding hills, it felt like someone had been here thousands of years before us. The formations almost gave the impression of an ancient civilization that lived and worked here but left their work unfinished. Thats just the thought that came to my mind while observing the place.

Manchar Lake is historically significant as the largest natural freshwater lake in Pakistan and one of Asia's great wetland ecosystems, once supporting an immense population of fisherfolk (Mohanas) and serving as a crucial stopover for Siberian migratory birds. Located near Sehwan Sharif, it is surrounded by ancient Harappan-era archaeological sites, underscoring its deep historical roots in the region. However, a responsible visitor must acknowledge the lake's current crisis; due to pollution from industrial and agricultural runoff, its water quality and biodiversity have been severely degraded. While the fluctuating size and the unique floating village lifestyle are compelling, the site currently requires urgent conservation efforts. It remains a powerful location for understanding Pakistans environmental challenges and its rich cultural past. At Manchar Lake I took an excursion to visit a small floating village of about 50 boats and 600 people. It was interesting but they certainly did a good job of asking for money at any opportunity. Very picturesque. It is the biggest lake of Pakistan ,but due to lack of interest of the previous governments in tourism, there is no designated picnic site at manchar lake, so you have to carry picnic stuff by yourself from home.

Hussaini Suspension Bridge,"Hussaini Suspension Bridge Bridge / Adventure spot Dramatic hanging bridge over Hunza River near Hussaini  popular (and scary) crossing for visitors to upper Hunza. A Thrilling Experience at Hussaini Suspension Bridge! Id seen the Hussaini Suspension Bridge countless times on YouTube, but nothing compares to seeing it in personits absolutely awesome. That first moment stepping onto the bridge was unforgettable. If youve got a fear of heights, this is definitely not the place for you. Crossing the bridge was both frightening and thrilling. It feels like the whole thing is moving, but its actually the water rushing beneath that messes with your senses. Just focus on the wooden planks and not the water. It took us around 30 to 40 minutes to get across one sideevery step required real nerves of steel. They do give you life jackets before crossing, which might sound reassuring at first. But we were bluntly told they wouldnt save usthe shock of falling into that freezing glacial water would likely be fatal. That definitely added to the intensity of the whole experience. Getting to the bridge isnt exactly easy either. Its a steep uphill climb with a lot of steps, so you need to be in decent shape. But once you're up there, the views are stunning and the adventure is totally worth it. And to top it all offwe zip-wired back across! It was the perfect adrenaline rush to end the journey. If youre ever in the area and looking for something unforgettable, this is one place you must experience. Hussaini Suspension Bridge in Hunza Valley is a unique and adventurous experience. Located over the Indus River in Hussaini Village, the journey starts by passing through the village itself, giving you a close look at local culture, lifestyle, and livelihood. Entry ticket is just Rs. 100, but its important to note that kids are not allowed to go far on the bridge due to safety concernsits genuinely dangerous and not for the faint-hearted. Theres also a zip line available at the site. However, during our visit, we saw someone get stuck midway while returning, which was enough for us to decide against trying it. One key thing to keep in mind is the extremely steep path on the way back. If you have difficulty walking on such inclines, its better to skip the hike. Carrying a water bottle is strongly recommended. The locals are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Most of the shops around the area are run by women, and their prices are surprisingly economical. I would sincerely encourage everyone to support them by purchasing somethingyou wont find such rates anywhere else. All in all, it was a wonderful and memorable experience. A must-try for anyone visiting Hunza Valley. One of the most beautiful suspension bridges I have ever been to.

A great place for families, students, and anyone who loves our culture! We had a great experience visiting the Lok Visa Heritage Museum. The exhibits were fascinating and well-curated. However, the air conditioning inside the museum could be improved for better comfort. Additionally, the food available outside the museum could be of better quality, especially considering the relatively high prices. Enhancing both comfort and value would make the overall experience even better. It is a good place to visit especially on festive days.

Empress Market,"Empress Market Historical Market The historic market has sections for spices, dried fruits, and traditional items. A must visit for everyone going to Karachi. It stands symbol for the colonial times and it is still used for its original purpose: a market. You will find spices, fruits and veggies, household items, meat. Empress Market in Saddar, Karachi, is more than just a market; it's a living piece of history. The grand, colonial-era building with its distinctive clock tower still stands proudly, a testament to its British Raj origins. While it has undergone significant changes in recent years, particularly with the removal of encroachments, its bustling spirit remains. Today, Empress Market is primarily a hub for wholesale and retail of fresh produce  fruits, vegetables, meat, and a dazzling array of spices that awaken the senses. You'll find vendors specializing in everything from exotic dry fruits to everyday condiments. It's a fantastic place to experience the raw, vibrant energy of Karachi's local commerce, with the constant chatter of vendors and the lively crowd. Though some of the informal stalls that once spilled out onto the streets are gone, the market continues to be an essential part of Karachi's daily life, offering competitive prices and a vast selection. It's a truly authentic Karachi experience, a place where history and commerce intertwine. Be prepared for a sensory overload in the best possible way! A Historic Landmark That Needs Better Maintenance Empress Market is one of Karachis most iconic landmarks, steeped in colonial history and bustling with activity. Built between 1884 and 1889, the market was constructed to commemorate Queen Victoria, the Empress of India, during British rule. However, its location has a deeper historical significancethis was the site where Mangal Pandey, along with other Indian soldiers, was reportedly executed after the 1857 War of Independence. Today, Empress Market remains a vital commercial hub, offering everything from spices and dry fruits to household goods. Walking through its grand arched entrance, you can still see remnants of its original British-era architecture, a reminder of its historical past. However, the market is now overcrowded, and while the variety of goods available is impressive, the overall cleanliness leaves much to be desired. The markets historic charm is overshadowed by litter, poor waste management, and encroachments. To truly restore Empress Markets former grandeur, there is an urgent need for better cleanliness and maintenance. Additionally, more greenery around the market would complement its historical aesthetics, making it a more pleasant space for visitors. Proper restoration efforts, along with stricter waste management policies, could transform this site into not just a shopping destination but also a well-preserved historical attraction. Despite these shortcomings, Empress Market remains a must-visit for those who appreciate Karachis rich history and vibrant street culture. A little more care and restoration could elevate it to a five-star landmark.",empress market historical market historic market section spice dry fruit traditional item visit go karachi stand symbol colonial time original purpose market find spice fruit veggie household item meat empress market saddar karachi market live piece history grand colonial era building distinctive clock tower stand proudly testament british raj origin undergo significant change recent year particularly removal encroachment bustling spirit remain today empress market primarily hub wholesale retail fresh produce fruit vegetable meat dazzling array spice awaken sense find vendor specialize exotic dry fruit everyday condiment fantastic place experience raw vibrant energy karachi local commerce constant chatter vendor lively crowd informal stall spill street go market continue essential karachi daily life offer competitive price vast selection truly authentic karachi experience place history commerce intertwine prepare sensory overload good possible way historic landmark need well maintenance empress market karachis iconic landmark steep colonial history bustle activity build market construct commemorate queen victoria empress india british rule location deep historical significancethis site mangal pandey indian soldier reportedly execute war independence today empress market remain vital commercial hub offer spice dry fruit household good walk grand arched entrance remnant original british era architecture reminder historical past market overcrowded variety good available impressive overall cleanliness leave desire market historic charm overshadow litter poor waste management encroachment truly restore empress market grandeur urgent need well cleanliness maintenance additionally greenery market complement historical aesthetic make pleasant space visitor proper restoration effort strict waste management policy transform site shopping destination preserve historical attraction despite shortcoming empress market remain visit appreciate karachis rich history vibrant street culture little care restoration elevate star landmark

Saddar Bazar: A Mixed Bag Saddar Bazar offers a mixed shopping experience. I found the area to be generally clean and accessible, with ATMs conveniently located throughout. You'll find a good selection of locally made clothing for women, men, and children. However, if you're looking for used clothing (londa), shoes, or a wide variety of clothing, this might not be the place. The londa available is limited and, in my experience, of very low quality. While some brand outlets exist (like Limelight, Edenrobe  though the men's western collection is limited , Bata, Ndure, Service, Urbansole, and Saya), the selection is not as extensive as in larger cities like Karachi or Lahore. The food options are also limited. There are no major national or international restaurant chains. A word of caution to juice lovers: I would strongly advise against buying juice here. I experienced severe stomach pain for 24 hours after drinking pineapple juice. Overall, Saddar Bazar is good for everyday clothing needs, especially local brands.

Shahi Bazaar,"Shahi Bazaar Historical Market Historic market known for its bangles, perfumes (ittar), and traditional bridal wear. One of oldest sweet shop in walled city of lahore, as my grandpa & great grandpa was also fan of this mithai shop's (     ). Which is quite rare nowadays. Even this sweet shop made that only on order basis. Anyways if we talk about the nashta only best thing I like that from beginning till now is halwa and pura, halwa  simply have no match at least in lahore however if we talk about Gujranwala's bombay sweets that was on other level. Puri is just normal nothing special and nothing less. About mutton tikki was also normal but good thing is perfectly on spice level rather like shaboo's mutton tikki with too much spices. Only drawback or you can say not recommending this place is due to unhygienic, low on cleanliness and smell of poor ventilation. If you can bear this or else you can takeaway for home or for your car dine in then go this is for you. Go and enjoy the taste  Tried their Mutton Tikki and Halwa Poori. The Mutton Tikki had a good amount of meat, so the price felt justified. However, the spices were quite mild. If they could enhance the seasoning a bit, it would be much better. Overall: 9/10. The Halwa Poori was just okaynothing special. The halwa itself was quite good, though. Overall: 8/10. The best Mithai I tasted on my travels through Lahore. A travellers delight, I couldnt recommend this place highly enough to those new to the city. The staff were extremely generous with their time as I sampled all the sweet treats. 10/10 Ismail, UK",shahi bazaar historical market historic market know bangle perfume ittar traditional bridal wear old sweet shop walled city lahore grandpa great grandpa fan mithai shop rare nowadays sweet shop order basis anyways talk nashta good thing like begin till halwa pura halwa simply match lahore talk gujranwala bombay sweet level puri normal special mutton tikki normal good thing perfectly spice level like shaboo mutton tikki spice drawback recommend place unhygienic low cleanliness smell poor ventilation bear takeaway home car dine enjoy taste try mutton tikki halwa poori mutton tikki good meat price feel justified spice mild enhance seasoning bit well overall halwa poori okaynothe special halwa good overall good mithai taste travel lahore traveller delight not recommend place highly new city staff extremely generous time sample sweet treat ismail uk

Camel Leather Craftsmen,"Camel Leather Craftsmen Leather Workshop Small workshops producing and selling camel leather journals, bags, and accessories. NEVER EVER BUY FROM THEM!! So, I ordered these camel leather lamps from Multan to Lahore. Firstly, they gave extremely high prices as compared to actual market prices. But owner named Mehboob assured me that these are of high quality and just trust us. So I agreed and paid them 10k through bank transfer. He was suppose to send me good quality 2x lamps 21 inch and 2x 16 inch lamps. - One 16 inch lamps have a deep press and it is now completely deformed. - The other 16 inch lamp is scratched and its paint is removed which kills all of its look. Moreover, it does not lights the bulb. The wiring is also faulty. - For the 21 inch lamp they did not send the grill, which holds the cap of lamp with its base. In short, never buy from them. They are stealing your money and will send trash for high prices. Ps. I am also attaching the screenshot of the conversation and to their arrogance. Once they send trash to you and then act like an arrogant. I ordered these camel lamps from them for Karachi. They gave me very high price and also sent me very very bad quality stuff. I switched on lamp for less than 1 hour and it started getting weakening. They are looting money from us.

Its a request to all of you please dont buy from this guy. Hes totally a scammer. Specially the one who dont know about guitars. Thank you He's a total scam. I gave him my guitar to install a pick up system, I gave 4500 as down payment. He first told me that the work would be done by tomorrow. But he delayed it for a week and after hearing the same thing that happened with another person that I know, he daid that he will deliver my guitar to where I live because the work would be delayed for another 5 days. I agreed. He sent the guitar but now kept delaying the return of the money that I gave him. He is not picking up any calls, not responding to my messages.

Bamboo Crafts (Changa Manga),"Bamboo Crafts (Changa Manga) Bamboo Craft Workshop Workshops selling baskets, furniture, and crafts made from local bamboo. Changa Manga is a big man-made forest near Lahore, Pakistan. Its a peaceful place full of trees, birds, and fun activities. Its great for a one-day picnic with family or friends.  What You Can Do There: Mini Train Ride A small train takes you through the jungle. Fun for kids and gives you a nice view of the forest. Boating There is a lake where you can enjoy paddle boating. Very calm and relaxing. Picnic Areas You can sit, eat, and relax under big shady trees. Good place to bring homemade food and enjoy nature. Animals You might see deer, monkeys, and birds. There is a small zoo as well. Walking & Cycling You can walk or ride a bike on the paths in the forest.  Good Things: Quiet and peaceful place Good for kids and families Beautiful nature and fresh air Cheap or free to enter This is a dream like beautiful place, especially when the weather is cloudy. The rope bridge is not only fun but also adds to the esthetic beauty of the place. Now they have reduced the area, still it seems appealing. The admin could do very well but alas! The lake is too muddy, the boats are rotting, the birds have flown away, the trees are quite less, the vendors don't have proper system to sell any goods, the toilets have no doors, and at the entrance it says that camera is watching you but you have to keep an eye on your vehicle in the parking in case it gets stolen. It seems funny yet pathetic. The train timings are not mentioned and it leaves as soon as they think its full. No written instructions how much time it takes to complete a circle, but it is mentioned that you pay 100 rs per person till 1 corner to the other (then to return to the 1st corner from where you sat there is probably another 100 rs. per person, but we couldn't take the previlege to get a ride) we kept waiting for the train to get back on its station but there was nobody to tell how much wait was required. So after 20 min we left that place. The tram outside has no fee structure, that person said 1000 rs for a family, but a family could be 10 people or more, or less, but he couldn't justify. In short it can be made the most beautiful place by little bit of care but nobody cares. Even the public doesn't care to take away its litter after enjoying the food. There are cats in scarcity and no squirrels at all, which is the biggest flaw. It proves that there is no place for animals and birds to live in the forest. We should be so loving that birds get back there, that squirrels get abundant, that bees make hives, that butterflies dance in distance and make our young children aware how a forest looks. I wish someone local, who can, reads this all and brings improvement. Review: A Wonderful Visit to Changa Manga, Lahore Our recent visit to Changa Manga, located near Lahore, was an incredible experience filled with fun and relaxation. Known as one of the largest man-made forests in the world, this place offers a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. From the moment we arrived, we were amazed by the lush greenery and the serene environment. The fresh air and scenic beauty made it a perfect spot for a picnic. We enjoyed walking through the forest trails, surrounded by towering trees and chirping birds, creating a peaceful atmosphere. One of the highlights of our visit was the famous Changa Manga train ride, which took us on a delightful journey through the forest. The boating area was another exciting experience, where we enjoyed paddling in the calm waters. The small zoo inside the park was a great attraction, especially for children. The park also has well-maintained picnic areas and food stalls, making it easy to relax and enjoy a meal with family and friends. The management has done a good job in keeping the place clean and safe for visitors. Overall, we had a fantastic time at Changa Manga. It is a must-visit destination for nature lovers and families looking for a peaceful getaway.",bamboo craft changa manga bamboo craft workshop workshop sell basket furniture craft local bamboo changa manga big man forest near lahore pakistan peaceful place tree bird fun activity great day picnic family friend mini train ride small train take jungle fun kid give nice view forest boat lake enjoy paddle boat calm relax picnic area sit eat relax big shady tree good place bring homemade food enjoy nature animal deer monkey bird small zoo walk cycling walk ride bike path forest good thing quiet peaceful place good kid family beautiful nature fresh air cheap free enter dream like beautiful place especially weather cloudy rope bridge fun add esthetic beauty place reduce area appeal admin alas lake muddy boat rot bird fly away tree vendor proper system sell good toilet door entrance say camera watch eye vehicle parking case get steal funny pathetic train timing mention leave soon think write instruction time take complete circle mention pay r person till corner return corner sit probably rs person previlege ride keep wait train station tell wait require min leave place tram outside fee structure person say rs family family people justify short beautiful place little bit care care public care away litter enjoy food cat scarcity squirrel big flaw prove place animal bird live forest loving bird squirrel abundant bee hive butterfly dance distance young child aware forest look wish local read bring improvement review wonderful visit changa manga lahore recent visit changa manga locate near lahore incredible experience fill fun relaxation know large man forest world place offer refreshing escape hustle bustle city life moment arrive amazed lush greenery serene environment fresh air scenic beauty perfect spot picnic enjoyed walk forest trail surround tower tree chirping bird create peaceful atmosphere highlight visit famous changa manga train ride take delightful journey forest boat area exciting experience enjoy paddle calm water small zoo inside park great attraction especially child park maintain picnic area food stall make easy relax enjoy meal family friend management good job keep place clean safe visitor overall fantastic time changa manga visit destination nature lover family look peaceful getaway

Freddie's Walled City (Heera Mandi),"Freddie's Walled City (Heera Mandi) Nihari / Paye Renowned for its rich, creamy paye (trotters) and nihari, a legacy of the old Heera Mandi. Finally got the chance to try Waris Nihari in Anarkali  its been on my list for a long time since theres so much hype around it and food bloggers seem to go crazy for it. Honestly, I found it a bit overhyped. First of all, the price is quite high  a small nihari costs Rs. 900. Yes, the portion is enough for two people, but still feels expensive compared to other places. The taste was good but not something out of this world or worth the massive hype. Service was another downside. I was expecting quick service for such a famous spot, but it was really slow  felt like it took forever just to get our order. Overall, its worth trying once for the experience and to see what the hype is about, but in my opinion, it doesnt fully live up to the reputation. Recently visited waris nehari with my friend. Overall experience was good. We ordered their nali nehari. If we talk about taste, I would say it was one the best nehari i ever tried. Although the environment and sitting arrangement was not well, but the taste and food quality was very good. If you want to feel old Androon Lahore vibes and taste authentic nali nehari in Lahore, Pakistan, Waris is one the best option. Ill go again for sure. It tasted pure, sumptuous...almost spiritual. The server was quite helpful. Atmosphere at the Anarkali market branch was average- I was on the ground floor (not the family lounge) and expected a little better. You need air conditioner to consume that much fat! All in all, the place deserves its fame. Highly recommended.",freddie walled city heera mandi nihari paye renowned rich creamy paye trotter nihari legacy old heera mandi finally get chance try waris nihari anarkali list long time s hype food blogger crazy honestly find bit overhype price high small nihari cost rs yes portion people feel expensive compare place taste good world worth massive hype service downside expect quick service famous spot slow feel like take forever order overall worth try experience hype opinion not fully live reputation recently visit waris nehari friend overall experience good order nali nehari talk taste good nehari try environment sitting arrangement taste food quality good want feel old androon lahore vibe taste authentic nali nehari lahore pakistan waris good option ill sure taste pure sumptuous spiritual server helpful atmosphere anarkali market branch ground floor family lounge expect little well need air conditioner consume fat place deserve fame highly recommend

There is a lot more cleanliness now then last time I visited. Staff is helpful and nice even though the bakery is quite busy all the time. Atmosphere is a little bit of negative point for the bakery dine in is very difficult, it's quite rushy and it is not even worth it. My recommendation is to take-out.

We sat on the roadside footpath , which gave a very basic vibedefinitely an area that could use some improvement for more comfortable outdoor seating. We ordered the classic halwa with puri, along with channay, aaloo tarkari, and achaar. While the service was fine, the puri was overly oily and the halwa could have been better in taste . Prices are moderate at around 300-500 per head, and breakfast is available until about 12 PM on weekends. They do offer separate seating for families inside, but we didn't get to try that out.

"Khalifa Nihari, Chitral Qila, Lahore","Khalifa Nihari, Chitral Qila, Lahore Nihari Another giant in the nihari world, known for its rich, slow-cooked beef stew served with naan. A timeless masterpiece of Mughal architecture  a must-visit for anyone who truly wants to experience the heart of Lahores history and culture. The Lahore Fort, locally known as Shahi Qila, is one of those rare places where you can genuinely feel the layers of history come alive around you. Located at the northern end of Lahores old walled city, right beside the majestic Badshahi Mosque, this fort is not just a tourist attraction  its a journey through centuries of art, power, and empire. I visited the fort on a calm afternoon, and it turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences Ive had in Lahore. The entrance through the Alamgiri Gate immediately sets the tone  grand, imposing, and filled with Mughal charm. As you walk in, you cant help but imagine how emperors like Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan once walked these same pathways. Every corner tells a story. The fort isnt a single building but a whole complex  with palaces, courtyards, gardens, and beautifully decorated halls that reflect different eras of Mughal and later Sikh influences. The Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors) is without doubt the highlight. The mirror work inside is breathtaking  thousands of tiny glass pieces reflect light in such a mesmerizing way that it feels almost magical. Even after centuries, the craftsmanship remains stunning. The Naulakha Pavilion is another gem  elegant white marble, intricate floral carvings, and a peaceful balcony view overlooking the city. You can easily spend hours admiring the details and still find something new every time you look closer. What I really appreciated was the forts restoration and preservation efforts by the authorities and UNESCO. Although some parts are still under maintenance, its heartening to see that the forts glory is being carefully revived rather than modernized. Information boards around the complex provide historical context, which makes the visit educational as well as visually fascinating. The museum section inside is worth a visit too. It houses ancient coins, Mughal armory, paintings, manuscripts, and artifacts that give you an even deeper insight into how life must have been during the Mughal era. The staff were polite and helpful, and the ticketing process was smooth. If youre planning to visit, Id recommend coming in the late afternoon when the light softens  its the perfect time for photography, especially when the sun hits the marble and red sandstone walls. The fort is right next to the Badshahi Mosque, Hazuri Bagh, and Minar-e-Pakistan, so you can make it part of a full-day heritage tour. In short, Lahore Fort isnt just a monument  its a living story of art, culture, and resilience. Whether youre a history lover, a photographer, or simply someone seeking inspiration, this place will leave you speechless. A must-see landmark that captures the true soul of Lahore and the golden age of the Mughal Empire. Its boring, we were done after getting some pictures. The government should work hard to preserve the originality of fort, as I saw most people ruining walls. Plus there is nothing other than the walls to see. There should be libraries, monuments. Some kind of of theme, to build public interest. Lahore Fort, also called Shahi Qila, is a magnificent Mughal monument built mainly by Emperor Akbar in 1566 and later expanded by Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. Located beside the Badshahi Mosque, it is famous for its grand gates, Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), Naulakha Pavilion, and beautiful marble work. The fort has witnessed the rule of Mughals, Sikhs, and the British, making it a symbol of rich history and culture. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction where visitors can experience the royal glory of the past.",khalifa nihari chitral qila lahore nihari giant nihari world know rich slow cook beef stew serve naan timeless masterpiece mughal architecture visit truly want experience heart lahore history culture lahore fort locally know shahi qila rare place genuinely feel layer history come alive locate northern end lahore old walled city right majestic badshahi mosque fort tourist attraction journey century art power empire visit fort calm afternoon turn memorable experience ve lahore entrance alamgiri gate immediately set tone grand imposing fill mughal charm walk not help imagine emperor like akbar jahangir shah jahan walk pathway corner tell story fort not single building complex palace courtyard garden beautifully decorate hall reflect different era mughal later sikh influence sheesh mahal palace mirror doubt highlight mirror work inside breathtake thousand tiny glass piece reflect light mesmerizing way feel magical century craftsmanship remain stunning naulakha pavilion gem elegant white marble intricate floral carving peaceful balcony view overlook city easily spend hour admire detail find new time look close appreciate fort restoration preservation effort authority unesco part maintenance heartening fort glory carefully revive modernize information board complex provide historical context make visit educational visually fascinating museum section inside worth visit house ancient coin mughal armory painting manuscript artifact deep insight life mughal era staff polite helpful ticketing process smooth plan visit d recommend come late afternoon light soften perfect time photography especially sun hit marble red sandstone wall fort right badshahi mosque hazuri bagh minar e pakistan day heritage tour short lahore fort not monument live story art culture resilience history lover photographer simply seek inspiration place leave speechless landmark capture true soul lahore golden age mughal empire boring get picture government work hard preserve originality fort see people ruin wall plus wall library monument kind theme build public interest lahore fort call shahi qila magnificent mughal monument build mainly emperor akbar later expand jahangir shah jahan aurangzeb locate badshahi mosque famous grand gate sheesh mahal palace mirror naulakha pavilion beautiful marble work fort witness rule mughal sikh british make symbol rich history culture today unesco world heritage site popular tourist attraction visitor experience royal glory past

"Bundo Khan, Multiple Outlets","Bundo Khan, Multiple Outlets BBQ / Kebabs A premier name for Pakistani BBQ (kebabs, tikka) in an upscale setting, starting from Karachi. Well my mother told me this is an OG spot and yes, we really liked it, family friendly environment, open air and also made a lil friend while waiting for our food. We had their beef seekh kabab (7/10), we were running late so had it at home. Kabab was for 1200 (100 per kabab) Recommended! Ps: we also got ourselves paan from a shop there xD. Bundu Khan is a timeless gem of Karachi! Revisiting it after 10 years was like a nostalgic trip to my childhood. The mutton kebabs remain mouthwatering, and the paratha chicken tikka combo still stands out as an unbeatable classic. This place has been serving BBQ excellence for decades, and their consistency is remarkable. While the quality is still top-notch, I did notice that the portion sizes, like the chicken tikka, have become smaller, and the seekh kababs are priced higher (Rs. 1,200 for 12 small pieces). Considering the current economic challenges, its understandable. The staff is courteous and attentive, and though the ambiance isn't extraordinary, the outdoor seating adds a nice touch. It's also wheelchair accessible, making it inclusive for all diners. Sindhi Muslim Society itself is a vibrant food street, and Bundu Khan remains its shining star. It may not be a fancy dining spot, but its flavor, heritage, and heart make it worth every visit. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic BBQ with a touch of nostalgia!

"Okra Restaurant, Lahore","Okra Restaurant, Lahore Fine Dining Mughlai A fine-dining establishment known for its modern take on traditional Pakistani and Mughlai dishes. Wow, just wow! Okra is an outstanding French restaurant in Karachi. I had heard from colleagues that it was truly excellent food, but I was skeptical as I find that my taste is my discerning that most people I know. However, I was truly amazed by the quality of the food, the beauty of the presentation, and the overall excellent service. I was with a group of colleagues and we shared some appetizers, two were fig based and were amazing! One was a mushroom dish that almost resembled meat  excellent flavor. I had a scallop dish for my main course, which was executed perfectly. The breads are also all made in-house. Overall, a truly gourmet experience  highly recommend that you try it. Note that the venue is small, and reservations are hard to come by so I recommend planning ahead (like months) if you want a reservation. Every visit to Okra is an experience of flavors. Love the fresh ingredients of dishes. And thank you to cheerful waiters staff who always take great care of us. For years, I avoided Okra, dismissing it as another overhyped spot. But curiosity got the better of me on my wedding anniversary, so I secured a lunch reservation after learning dinner was booked weeks in advance. The experience was, unfortunately, underwhelming. While Okra thrives on its exclusivity and reputation, the food does little to justify its price tag. We arrived at noon, and the staff promptly welcomed us. The hospitality, Ill admit, was flawlesswarm, attentive, and professional. However, the ambiance left much to be desired. The restaurant, though cozy with a Mediterranean touch, felt oppressively cramped. It seemed as though every square inch had been maximized, evoking the claustrophobia of a Tokyo eatery. Seating, too, was uncomfortable. Within 15 minutes, my back and legs began protesting, a sentiment taller patrons would echo. The complimentary bread basket turned out to be the highlight of our meal. Fresh, aromatic, and inviting, it hinted at the culinary finesse I had hoped for. Yet the accompanying condiments were bland and uninspired, setting the tone for what was to follow. We started with the crab on toast, which was, frankly, a disappointment. Despite a herby topping, it lacked flavor and was inexplicably salty. The crab itself was dry, streaky, and texturally off-putting. I struggled to take more than two bites. The ""Steak and Eggs"" followeda dish that felt like a misstep on every level. The eggs, served sunny-side up, were a disaster: whites undercooked and almost rubbery, yolks raw and unpleasantly fragrant. My wife couldnt finish hers due to the off-putting smell. The steak, meanwhile, consisted of two overcooked, bite-sized medallions that were tough, charred, and utterly joyless. At nearly Rs. 3,000, the dish felt not only overpriced but also insultingingredients that likely cost a fraction of the price failed to deliver even basic satisfaction. Desperate for redemption, I opted for the cheeseburger, hoping it would be a safer bet. What arrived was an ordinary beefburger with a charred, chewy patty and little else to commend it. While the patty was juicy, it lacked the tenderness and seasoning expected at this price point. The accompanying fries, soggy and bland, were no better than what one might find at a roadside stall for a fraction of the cost. The meals saving grace, surprisingly, came in the form of a drink: the Campagna with a hint of chocolate. Silky, well-balanced, and indulgent, it reminded us of what the restaurant is capable of if it pays attention to detail. Okra, I understand, thrives on exclusivity, with months-long reservations, at times, and an air of prestige. For some, dining here may be more about bragging rights than culinary substance. But for those who value flavor, creativity, and quality over mere appearances, Okra is likely to disappoint. In a city where dining out is one of the few leisure activities, this restaurant trades too heavily on its reputation and fails to deliver the kind of experience its price tag demands.",okra restaurant lahore fine dining mughlai fine dining establishment know modern traditional pakistani mughlai dish wow wow okra outstanding french restaurant karachi hear colleague truly excellent food skeptical find taste discerning people know truly amazed quality food beauty presentation overall excellent service group colleague share appetizer fig base amazing mushroom dish resemble meat excellent flavor scallop dish main course execute perfectly bread house overall truly gourmet experience highly recommend try note venue small reservation hard come recommend plan ahead like month want reservation visit okra experience flavor love fresh ingredient dish thank cheerful waiter staff great care year avoid okra dismiss overhyped spot curiosity get well wedding anniversary secure lunch reservation learn dinner book week advance experience unfortunately underwhelming okra thrive exclusivity reputation food little justify price tag arrive noon staff promptly welcome hospitality ill admit flawlesswarm attentive professional ambiance leave desire restaurant cozy mediterranean touch felt oppressively cramp square inch maximize evoke claustrophobia tokyo eatery seating uncomfortable minute leg begin protest sentiment tall patron echo complimentary bread basket turn highlight meal fresh aromatic inviting hint culinary finesse hope accompany condiment bland uninspired set tone follow start crab toast frankly disappointment despite herby topping lack flavor inexplicably salty crab dry streaky texturally putting struggle bite steak egg followeda dish feel like misstep level egg serve sunny disaster white undercooke rubbery yolk raw unpleasantly fragrant wife not finish put smell steak consist overcooked bite sized medallion tough charred utterly joyless nearly rs dish feel overpriced insultingingredient likely cost fraction price fail deliver basic satisfaction desperate redemption opt cheeseburger hope safe bet arrive ordinary beefburger charred chewy patty little commend patty juicy lack tenderness seasoning expect price point accompany fry soggy bland well find roadside stall fraction cost meal save grace surprisingly come form drink campagna hint chocolate silky balance indulgent remind restaurant capable pay attention detail okra understand thrive exclusivity month long reservation time air prestige dining bragging right culinary substance value flavor creativity quality mere appearance okra likely disappoint city dine leisure activity restaurant trade heavily reputation fail deliver kind experience price tag demand

Charsi Tikka,"Charsi Tikka BBQ / Grill The most famous street in Peshawar for its massive, perfectly grilled lamb chops and tikka. Located in the heart of the historic Namak Mandi in Peshawar, Nisar Charsi Tikka is one of the most iconic places to experience authentic Peshawari BBQ and traditional cuisine. For those unfamiliar, Namak Mandi has been a famous food street for decades, known for its rich culinary heritage, especially lamb dishes cooked in desi ghee and simple spices  letting the meat speak for itself. Its a must-visit area for anyone who wants a true taste of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At Nisar Charsi Tikka, the food absolutely lives up to the hype. The Patta Tikka, Mutton/Lamb Tikka, and the Peshawari Lamb Karahi are the standout dishes  juicy, tender, and full of flavor. Everything is cooked fresh, with meat brought out for your approval before grilling or karahi preparation begins. That said, be prepared for a no-frills, old-school setup. The service can feel a bit rushed, and the owner is known to be slightly rude or blunt, which can catch first-time visitors off guard. But if you go in for the food and not the pampering, youll likely have a great time, just like I did. Overall: A must-visit for meat lovers. The flavors are unforgettable, and the food is a true reflection of Peshawars culinary culture. Just go with a bit of patience  and a big appetite. If you want taste and good value for your it is for you. I appreciate the taste of this restaurant at Namak Mandi and the weight exactly according to your order. Sometimes the service is not according to the expectations as expectations always hurt. If I could recommend it would be taste and weight the cuisine served. If I could suggest it would be service. Sometimes, it may take an hour or two to be served. Food was slow but worth the wait. Karahi sauce was very very good and the shinwari was super.

Jani Ice Cream,"Jani Ice Cream Ice Cream Parlor A legendary ice cream parlor known for its unique, dense texture and classic flavors like pistachio. It's a real shame to hear that the food quality was poor. A burnt zinger burger is certainly not appetizing, and when the food isn't delicious, it really takes away from the whole experience. Cleanliness in a food establishment is so important too, so it's concerning to hear that was lacking. When you combine subpar food and poor hygiene, it's completely understandable that you'd feel unsatisfied. To top it off, it sounds like the high prices didn't match the level of service or the quality of the food you received. That's incredibly disappointing, as you expect to get what you pay for. It's tough when you feel like you've wasted your money on a meal that didn't meet even basic expectations.

Everything was superb! The pancake was freshly baked, the omelette was creamy and flavorful, and the walnut cake truly deserves its reputationmoist, rich, and unforgettable The Hunza tea had a light, herbal punch with honey that was both refreshing and unique. It cost us Rs. 5,600 for 9 people, which is quite reasonable for such quality food and ambience. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hunza! I found the famous walnut cake good but not exceptional. It was quite dry and the texture wasnt soft and moist like a cake, but more like a biscuit. The rose tea was great though, highly recommend that.

Hidden Paradise Restaurant,"Hidden Paradise Restaurant Fresh Trout Fish Known for its trout fish, taken fresh from the river and served with a view of the Kunhar River. The best place to try local Hunza food. The food is very filling and the service is excellent since our server suggested good options for us to order and patiently explained each and every dish. It is best to order a platter if you are many persons. It is expensive but it is totally worth it. Clean, fresh organic food. The Chupshoros are amazing both the Yak Meat ones and the cheese ones. The meal is very filling since they use apricot oil. A must try! I have mixed opinions about this restaurant. When I visited, they had power outage and offered candle light dinner, which was odd. I only ordered for take away. They offered a free taste for their stake too, which was great. The issue is with the actual order I placed, I ordered Chap Shoru, their traditional pizza, it was pathetic and extremely expensive. I have had the same dish from other place with one tenth the price and good taste. So if you visit, only order the stake! i am glad i found this place while walk on Karim Abad road. i visited number of restaurant but all of them has same food to offer and hardly offer traditional hunzai food. the place is so quiet with best view of Altit and ultar peak. they offer all kind of local cuisine specifically uniquely tailored to your taste nd i must say they have great chef and friendly staff...if visit hunza again will definitely visit this place with frds",hide paradise restaurant fresh trout fish know trout fish take fresh river serve view kunhar river good place try local hunza food food filling service excellent server suggest good option order patiently explain dish good order platter person expensive totally worth clean fresh organic food chupshoros amazing yak meat one cheese one meal filling use apricot oil try mix opinion restaurant visit power outage offer candle light dinner odd order away offer free taste stake great issue actual order place order chap shoru traditional pizza pathetic extremely expensive dish place tenth price good taste visit order stake glad find place walk karim abad road visit number restaurant food offer hardly offer traditional hunzai food place quiet good view altit ultar peak offer kind local cuisine specifically uniquely tailor taste nd great chef friendly staff visit hunza definitely visit place frd

We ordered their famous walnut cake, pancake with Nutella, brownie, Pakistani complete breakfast, cheese & mushroom omelette, regular tea, and the refreshing Hunza tea with honey. Everything was superb! The pancake was freshly baked, the omelette was creamy and flavorful, and the walnut cake truly deserves its reputationmoist, rich, and unforgettable The Hunza tea had a light, herbal punch with honey that was both refreshing and unique. It cost us Rs. 5,600 for 9 people, which is quite reasonable for such quality food and ambience. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hunza! I found the famous walnut cake good but not exceptional. It was quite dry and the texture wasnt soft and moist like a cake, but more like a biscuit. The rose tea was great though, highly recommend that.

We had both dinner and breakfast at Moon Restaurant during our visit to Naran. Overall, it was a decent experience. Breakfast items like halwa puri, chanay, omelet, and naan were tasty and satisfying. For dinner, chicken karahi, chapli kebab and daal were delicious, while Sabzi and Chinese shashlik with rice were average. The food quality overall was satisfactory, though the portion sizes felt a bit small for the price. That said, the prices werent too high, but slightly better quantity wouldve added more value. In conclusion, Moon Restaurant is a decent and reliable spot for meals in Naran, especially for those looking for local, continental, Chinese and other options. Hats off to everything.

Hunza Serena Inn Restaurant,"Hunza Serena Inn Restaurant Upscale Dining An upscale option offering international and local dishes in a beautiful, traditional setting. Everything about Hunza Serena feels perfect  except the service. Having stayed at many Serena properties across Pakistan, I came in with high expectations. During my stay at Gilgit Serena last year, the staff treated us like royalty  anticipating our needs before we even voiced them. Hunza, unfortunately, fell short of that standard. Hotel & Location: The property itself is beautifully designed, perfectly located, and surrounded by breathtaking views. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and recently renovated, offering all the amenities one would expect from Serena. Rooms and Service: The most crazy thing was the lights. The bed side table lamps would not get turned off from any switch, we had to pull out the cable from under the table. Other light switches were also as if out of Alice in Wonderland, you would never be able to predict which switch elicited what reaction in the lights! Despite the lovely rooms, housekeeping was inconsistent. Used glasses and empty water bottles were removed but never replaced, and small details like this added up over the stay. Dining: The breakfast buffet was excellent  diverse, fresh, and satisfying. Food in the restaurants and room service menu were also good. However, the dining system was unnecessarily rigid and service was again below par. You could order Pizza and snacks at one restaurant on one side of the hotel, and other dishes in the other restaurant at the other end. Asking them to bring pizza to the other restaurant, or even taking it away to the other was not accepted. We had to sit in one restaurant while my daughter had her pizza, then move to the other for my food. Health Club & Pool: The facilities were impressive: separate ladies locker room with sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi; a standard gym; 2 outdoor heated pools (1 for kids) with mountain views. That said, there was no staff support, which felt both inconvenient and unsafe. No one was available in the ladies locker room to provide towels or locker keys, and the jacuzzi was under maintenance - staff more concerned about you getting out of their way than to help you. The sauna and steam room could not be turned on also because no-one was there (or willing) to do it. There was no staff not even a lifeguard at the pool, which is very concerning for guest safety. Spa Experience: I booked myself a 90-minute massage and arrived at the counter just a few minutes late, although I was in the spa. They asked me to fill a form, in which, among other things, I wrote that I wanted a medium massage. I was taken to the massage room 15 minutes after the start of my appointment. The masseuse washed my feet first and started the massage 20 minutes after the start time. The massage was nothing to write home about. When I asked her to put more pressure, she told me I had asked for a medium pressure, not a firm one. However, she did not read the part where I wrote I did not want my head to be massaged and proceeded to do it. She ended the massage bang on time, even though it had started 20 minutes late. I did not have the time on me, but I checked when I came to the locker room. So I got a 70-minute massage instead of 90. And the jacuzzi in the female locker room was not working, they told me I could use the jacuzzi in the male section, but I would be charged 10,000 rupees for half an hour. Overall: Hunza Serena has immense potential  stunning setting, well-designed facilities, and the Serena brand promise. But the service quality needs serious improvement to match the standards of other Serena properties. I truly hope the management will take steps to bring Hunzas hospitality up to the level that makes Serena so special elsewhere in Pakistan. An amazing hotel with beautiful views and great staff. We have been here a few days now and I highly recommend staying at this hotel with its close proximity to the bazaar and its gorgeous setting. We were well looked after and the staff can not be faulted in any way for their hospitality and efforts to ensure you have a truly amazing experience. A special mention for Duty Manager Farah who was exceptional and a truly gifted member of staff who was well informed on what a guest would expect and how to accommodate their requirements and expectations. I will be coming back and will stay here again. Excellent hotel with breathtaking views. Rooms were fantastic and quite big. Breakfast had a good selection of international and local options, the service froms taff in the breakfast hall was great. Staff are always helpful and things are done pretty instantly here.

Amazing Scenery, breath taking views, cold streams, Lovely flowers, and chirping birds.. Nature has been kind to it.. It's sad to find Tourists littering the place. Me and My friend collected 2 bags full and deposited them at bins erected by local authorities.. Also plz don't put Loud Music into here, sound pollution is a hazard, and quite a few foreign tourists were complaining about it.. We rented a tent by a stream, its affordable, but sanitary conditions are appalling.. The quilts and pillows had mould and bugs.. Food served is NOT good for Health, You had to tell them thrice, what you wanted. Local people are polite and smiling all the time, Tourists should respect their culture and customs.. If you are with family, My humble advice is that in present sanitary conditions don't stay for Night, Skardu is nearby on 3 hours drive, rest there ..

I bought a Christmas tree, a styrofoam star and some red tinsel. The staff was really friendly and helpful as well. The prices of the Christmas ornaments were a bit inflated as compared to the rest of the market, so they could fix that. The shop was well organized as well. Easy to find and the guard outside helped me park my car and was really helpful. Very bad experience with Jahangir Sons. Due to miscommunication, I have bought a study pack of city school nursery class, which was supposed to be replaced with a city school alpha nursery. My PKR 11000+ was wasted and I have to buy another study pack because Jahangir Sons management was not returning the study pack just because one book was labeled with the name. They don't even return those books which were untouched and never used. Literally, they are ruthless when it comes to customers money. Update 30 Aug 2023: Jahangir Son replied to this review and said they will fix the issue. But the reality is, they did nothing. They never contacted me and they didnt return the brand new books and copies of worth PKR 11000+. They just reply here for the sake of Google rating. Whoever the admin here.

Otherwise, there are other places which offer good calue for money spent The sewerage line had overflown just outside the main entrance and we had to find our way in without drenching our feet in stinking water. Having entered, we found a restaurant upstairs that had fairly good decor and ambiance. We ordered behari boti, afghani beef tikka, maghaz and daal. Service was a bit slow. Maghaz (brain masala) was well cooked and so was daal maash. Behari boti was just ok and Afghani tikka was not good at all. An average food. Rates are reasonable and it will cost you 700 to 1000 per head, depending on the order. Finding a parking on the road may be a problem. Below average place infact.

We still ordered the biryani, but the service was poor. Our food was ready and sitting there for 10 minutes, and no one even bothered to call us to say our order is ready, When we opened the box, it was a huge letdown, tiny piece of meat, rice way too spicy, and overall not edible. Sharing a picture for reference. Save your money and skip this place. Today I ordered the BBQ Thali which cost around 2000 rupees. When it was served, I was honestly shocked to see the quantity. The menu clearly mentioned it was for 2 persons, but in reality it was barely enough for 1. The portion size was extremely low compared to the price. It felt like a scam and I was really disappointed with the experience. Good food. Ordered traditional thali which was nice. Food was tasty especially malai boti was very yummy.

Bhaiya Kabab,"Bhaiya Kabab Kebabs A famous spot in Karachi's Gulshan-e-Iqbal for its seekh kebabs and parathas. Food was very good in terms of taste but the quantity is way too less. Very less quantity of kababs and afghani boti and the bill is around 9000/- too much for only three people. rlRecently visited with friends, Bhayya Kabab Shop in D Block, Model Town, but unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing. The overall taste of the food was very average, and it definitely didnt live up to the hype. The prices felt quite high compared to the quality and quantity being served. Another drawback was that they dont follow a proper per kg or weight-based system, everything is only sold in plates or dozens, which doesnt feel fair for customers who want value for money. I tried some of their most popular items: the beef kabab, Afghani boti, and beef tikka boti, along with paratha, roti, and their two chutneys (podina and imli). Sadly, nothing really stood out, the taste was underwhelming, the portion sizes were small, and the quality was not what I expected. Overall, it was not a satisfying experience, and I personally wouldnt recommend it nor plan to visit again. The place has very good value for money The prices are quite reasonable with good taste. Sitting area is nice for bachelors and for all families it's ok. The food quality seems not bad.

There is a lot more cleanliness now then last time I visited. Staff is helpful and nice even though the bakery is quite busy all the time. Atmosphere is a little bit of negative point for the bakery dine in is very difficult, it's quite rushy and it is not even worth it. My recommendation is to take-out. Another thing that i am quite surprised about is the prices. Prices have not changed much and i admired that 8bje ye cake inki shop se lia tha aik dum bassi or boosa hua complain krne pr kehdia k aisa he hta he fridge me rkh k khalain pathetic service , 0 quality food must try their cake before purchase to safe yourself from wasting your money video review coming soon on fb, yt ans insta on Ather_k_vlog Visited on a Sunday morning with friends for breakfast. This place is quite hyped for its traditional halwa puri in Karachi, but I found it just average compared to other options like DilPasand (Nazimabad) or Hafiz (Malir). We sat on the roadside footpath , which gave a very basic vibedefinitely an area that could use some improvement for more comfortable outdoor seating. We ordered the classic halwa with puri, along with channay, aaloo tarkari, and achaar. While the service was fine, the puri was overly oily and the halwa could have been better in taste . Prices are moderate at around 300-500 per head, and breakfast is available until about 12 PM on weekends. They do offer separate seating for families inside, but we didn't get to try that out.

Lahori Fish Fry,"Lahori Fish Fry Fish Fry Iconic spots in Lahore, like at Mozang Chungi, famous for their spicy, fried fish. If youre looking for the true Siddique Fish experience, this is the real and authentic branch to visit. They specialize in perfectly fried fish, cooked in high-quality mustard oil for a rich and traditional flavor. We ordered Rahu fish, and it was simply outstanding. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside, with spices that were perfectly balanced. The cleanliness and freshness of the fish were evident, making the meal even more enjoyable. The service was excellent, with a courteous staff ensuring a smooth and pleasant dining experience. For all fish lovers, Siddique Fish is a must-try! You wont be disappointed. It was used to be a good spot for fish but my this experience on 03-JAN-2025 was a total disappointment. The rates a too exaggerated merely because of the hype. Fish was not properly fried, it was still watery and not fully cooked. It was served dripping of oil and oil too wasn't seeming like of quality. A total disappointment. Not a big fan of sweet water fish, untill I tried it here. Very good taste and fresh.

Hyderabadi Biryani House,"Hyderabadi Biryani House Biryani Famous for its authentic Hyderabadi-style biryani in Karachi. I've been a customer at Master Biryani for the last 30 years. When it comes to biryani restaurants, Master Biryani stands out as a lesser-known option compared to other biryani places, but for me, this is my all time favorite place for Biryani. What I really enjoy about their biryani is the unique flavor of the rice and biryani spices, along with the tasty potatoes and tender chicken. This biryani, in my opinion, is the best in Karachi. If you're around the old area, New Chali, or near Bolton Market, I suggest you try it at least once. Currently, a plate of biryani costs Rs. 280, which might be due to the overall increase in prices. The place is somewhat  accessible for people with different abilities, but parking can be a problem here. one of the oldest and best place for biryani lover offering chicken beef and fish biryani as well. also serving fry fish and other curries with orti chappati. fthe taste of biryani is somehow very incline to hyderabadi style biryani and i believe that is originated from any other state of india . we tried chixken and beef but missed to taste fish Kund biryani or fry. only available at lunch time due to vicinity of business area.

Waris Nihari,"Waris Nihari Nihari A famous name in Lahore's Mughalpura area, known for its flavorful and hearty nihari. Finally got the chance to try Waris Nihari in Anarkali  its been on my list for a long time since theres so much hype around it and food bloggers seem to go crazy for it. Honestly, I found it a bit overhyped. First of all, the price is quite high  a small nihari costs Rs. 900. Yes, the portion is enough for two people, but still feels expensive compared to other places. The taste was good but not something out of this world or worth the massive hype. Service was another downside. I was expecting quick service for such a famous spot, but it was really slow  felt like it took forever just to get our order. Overall, its worth trying once for the experience and to see what the hype is about, but in my opinion, it doesnt fully live up to the reputation. Recently visited waris nehari with my friend. Overall experience was good. We ordered their nali nehari. If we talk about taste, I would say it was one the best nehari i ever tried. Although the environment and sitting arrangement was not well, but the taste and food quality was very good. If you want to feel old Androon Lahore vibes and taste authentic nali nehari in Lahore, Pakistan, Waris is one the best option. Ill go again for sure. It tasted pure, sumptuous...almost spiritual. The server was quite helpful. Atmosphere at the Anarkali market branch was average- I was on the ground floor (not the family lounge) and expected a little better. You need air conditioner to consume that much fat! All in all, the place deserves its fame.

Chacha Feeka,"Chacha Feeka Street Food (Feeka) An iconic, decades-old cart in Lahore's Anarkali Bazaar, famous for its ""Feeka"" (a spiced chickpea snack). We tried khoey wali lassi. It was very thick and heavy. Taste was excellent. We tried after breakfast but I think there is no need to take breakfast if you are going to try Feekay ki Lassi! 27/7/25 I am a Lahori, but I first heard about this lassi about 10 years back, around 2015. This was my first visit here. I first went to Jeda Lassi, but it was sold out at 8:20AM as it was Sunday. So I drove here instead. I ordered the expensive version: 350/glass Pera lassi. Dahi lassi is 200/glass. The guy churns the butter in front of you for 10 mins, and makes the lassi with the watery butter milk! They crushed ice (must be from some factory, so no exactly hygienic) in a 50kg sugar sack and added a palm full to the glass. Then he scooped out butter with his palm and put it on top of the watery lassi. Then crushed and added Rs.50 worth of perra on top. So this version of lassi is buttermilk with 2 toppings. With a spoon, you eat the very sugary peera with some butter and then sip the thin lassi. Milk quality was meh as per my assessment, but then again, I didn't exactly have pure milk, only this diluted butter milk. I don't like sugar overdose. So this was perfect for me that the only sugar it had was in the perra so you can basically take as much or little sweetness as you like with a spoon with each sip. From the vloggers, I had heard that it is very filling and you can't finish it. This was my breakfast, and I can tell you it filled me decently, but it was not difficult to finish. I think pera lassi is unique and not available widely elsewhere so you can come try it. My favourite lassi so far is the thick, creamy Tariq sweets lassi on hall road. Visit 2: 14/9/25 Went for Dahi lassi. Very little malai added on top and sweetness level was a bit high for me. Milk quality was just okay, and even dahi lassi wasn't very thick. It was a decent 7/10. It wasn't filling enough for me as breakfast, so I went to test the Tariq sweets lassi on hall road right after it for a proper comparison. Tariq had very good milk quality, very creamy and thick yogurt and just the right amount of sugar. The milk fat sticks to your tongue. But the malai topping was so much and so thick that it felt fake cornflour to me. Overall, I would rate that 9/10. Bakwas dirty not the worth at all, looked like the yogurt was not fresh nor the milk. Really disappointed if this is the original feeka lassi. I really doubt this is the og feeka lassi correct me if I m wrong. In comparison ambala milk shop faisal town lassi 140 pkr awesome fresh disposable glass cold.

Karachi's Iceberg,"Karachi's Iceberg Ice Cream Parlor One of the oldest and most famous ice cream parlors in the city. Iceberg is that ice cream place which has been the first choice of Karachiites for decades. Especially their innovative flavors like Geto, Sicilian, Rose Rabri, Strawberry Cheesecake, and Mango are extremely popular, particularly in my family, where theyre loved by everyone. None of our family gatherings ever feel complete without Icebergs ice cream, no matter what the season is. Most of the time, weve taken it as takeaway, but last week we happened to dine in, and it was even more enjoyable, this time I tried their Kulfi Falooda, and it was amazing. The sitting area is small but beautifully designed, with a few chairs outside as well if you prefer not to sit in the chilled AC. And because of this setup, the place is completely accessible for wheelchair users. Car parking, however, can be an issue here, as everyone knows the usual traffic situation in Saddar.

Lahore's Phajji Ke Paye,"Lahore's Phajji Ke Paye Paye A legendary spot in Lahore's Ichhra Bazaar, famous for its paye (trotters). We ordered their Bong Paye with Mikh (Beef Shank Meat with Beef Trotters and Bone Marrow) and Chota Paya with bone marrow (Mutton Trotter with Bone Marrow). The taste was delicious, mouthwatering and satisfying. Their Maghz (Brain) is top notch which was already finished when we reached at 11:00AM. I had a very bad experience. Expensive and and the smallest laal Botti I have ever seen in a bong. Picture is from 2 plates that we bought as take out. 900 rupees per plate and teaspoon size meat in each plate. Heard many good reviews about this place so on a cold morning decided to try bong paaye here. Location: it's on the main allama Iqbal road so you don't need to cover a long distance once you take right term after the dharampura railway line. The place: it's on the first floor of a building with a quite bad entrance for families Maybe but once you enter the first floor, it's neat and clean with dining halls on both sides. The one on the right side is the family hall. Food: coming to the main item. We ordered full bong paaye with mekh (bone marrow/ guuda). The quantity was excellent for two people. Along with it, we'd naan which were excellent. Bong paaye looked good if not very appealing. The good thing was that there wasn't any bad smell (which often comes in commercially made paaye) coming out of it but the taste itself was quite bland..I mean it doesn't satisfy the appetite for paaye...it wasn't bad either but it was also not something worth coming back also. You can visit this place without expecting some extraordinary taste. They've their own tandoor so naans come super hot and they're something I definitely loved. Service: excellent service. The guy was super active always asking the customers if they need anything else. Replacing cold naans with the hot ones and serving extra gravy as well. Full marks for the service.",lahore phajji ke paye paye legendary spot lahore ichhra bazaar famous paye trotter order bong paye mikh beef shank meat beef trotter bone marrow chota paya bone marrow mutton trotter bone marrow taste delicious mouthwatering satisfying maghz brain notch finish reach bad experience expensive small laal botti see bong picture plate buy rupee plate teaspoon size meat plate hear good review place cold morning decide try bong paaye location main allama iqbal road need cover long distance right term dharampura railway line place floor building bad entrance family maybe enter floor neat clean dining hall side right family hall food come main item order bong paaye mekh bone guuda quantity excellent people naan excellent bong paaye look good appealing good thing bad smell come commercially paaye come taste bland mean satisfy appetite paaye bad worth come visit place expect extraordinary taste tandoor naan come super hot definitely love service excellent service guy super active ask customer need replace cold naan hot one serve extra gravy mark service

It was used to be a good spot for fish but my this experience on 03-JAN-2025 was a total disappointment. The rates a too exaggerated merely because of the hype. Fish was not properly fried, it was still watery and not fully cooked. It was served dripping of oil and oil too wasn't seeming like of quality. A total disappointment. Not a big fan of sweet water fish, untill I tried it here. Very good taste and fresh.

Lahore's Street Jalebi,"Lahore's Street Jalebi Jalebi Hot, crispy jalebis sold from carts across the city, especially in the old quarters. Firstly they are using the name of GRATO jalebi but now I think due to crack down on trademark issue they start using name of crispy. Thanks to institutions for making thing right. About taste yes very good taste and especially during raining season and night huge crowd gathered to take the bite. About cleanliness same traditional safai in kitchen area and serving area which need to be take care to start journey towards mega brand. Grato Jalebi is situated near Camp Jail in front of LS stop and at the corner of road coming from Shadman and meeting with Ferozpur Road, Lahore - Pakistan. This Jalebi is a sweet dish in Pakistan, specially in Punjab. This Grato Jalebi is originally from Rawalpindi and they do have a restaurant in Islamabad as well. In Lahore they have made around 4 to 5 branches. They do have Jalebi with sugar free mode as well and also with less sugar. These modes of Jalebi is being launched in a week or so from now. Along with Jalebi they have already launched samosas, a fried snack of south Asian countries. The prices are a bit higher but taste is very good so it's worth trying. Seating isn't available by so only takeouts are offered. Amazing Jalebi, mouth watering, finger licking good. The taste is so good that you cant resist eating. Only ask for fresh and hot Jalebi, if they are not fresh then you wont enjoy it. The also have amazing Gulabjamans and you must try them too. Both these sweets are just too good and you will love them. They also have very tasty Pakoray, their pakoray are with potato fires and potato makes their Pakoray really good. I havent tried but they also serve chicken and vegitable Samosay and Rolls, they looked good too.

Worst experience ever at Nihari Inn! We went there for lunch and asked for extra Nihari gravy (and agreed to pay for it). First, the waiter refused. Then after a few minutes, he brought something and shamelessly added it to our plates  it wasnt even Nihari gravy, it was clearly Qorma gravy! When we confronted him, he blatantly lied to our faces. Even when it was obvious, he kept arguing! We had to call the manager. Instead of solving the issue, the waiter started running around like a guilty thief. Finally, the staff admitted it was Qorma gravy. If that wasnt enough, they also tried to scam us with a fake pre-payment bill! Only after serious arguments did they hand over the real bill.

During my visit, I saw something in my paratha. When I raised this issue with staff, I was told that it was not a big deal and that it wasnt poisonous or dangerous, essentially dismissing the seriousness of the situation. Instead of accepting their mistake and taking action, they acted as if it was nothing to be worried about or taken seriously. It is unacceptable to wait until a truly hazardous substance is found before taking action.

The balcony view was simply breathtaking  waking up to snow-capped mountains and crisp morning air was a true delight. I stayed there for a night. The rooms Was clean, well equipped with necessities such as hygiene kit, prayer mat etc. I paid PKR 8000/- for a single window room with double bed. The allied restaurant is on the opposite side of the road and the guys there are nice, welcoming but the food is average.

Karachi's Malai Boti,"Karachi's Malai Boti Malai Boti Creamy, tender chunks of chicken or beef grilled on skewers. I wanted to try out Noorani Kabab House Kata Kat for quite sometime. I had tried Noorani Kata Kat about 18-20 years ago. Today on my way back from book launch I came to Noorani Kabab House. I ordered Kata Kat Mix Plate Rs 1,480. It was Kata Kat of Mutton Kidney, Heart, Kapoora, Mutton Ribs & Brain. But the taste was more of a Brain Masala. We also ordered Nan, Paratha and Chapati. It tasted best with Nan. The total bill came to Rs 1,960. The quantity and taste of food was such that it will not attract me to come back soon. Moreover the seating arrangements for non family is on footpath and for families they have seating arrangements of hall over the kitchen area. The service is slow and one has to shout for waiters to attract attention. Payment cash only. Norani Kabab House  A True Taste of Karachis Desi Delights Located in the bustling heart of Karachi, Norani Kabab House is one of those classic desi spots that never fail to satisfy your craving for traditional Pakistani BBQ. Whether youre a student hunting for budget-friendly food, or a family looking for authentic Karachi flavors, Norani Kabab House delivers consistently good taste with no frills attached. The highlight of their menu is undoubtedly the Chicken Malai Boti  perfectly tender, creamy, and bursting with smoky flavor. Their Seekh Kababs are juicy and spiced just right, served fresh off the grill with paratha or naan. The Chicken Tikka is another crowd-pleaser, with a rich, fiery marination that BBQ lovers will appreciate. Portions are generous and prices are quite reasonable, especially considering the quality and freshness of the meat. The vibe is very local  plastic chairs, open-air seating, and the lively noise of grills sizzling in the background. Service is fast, but don't expect five-star polish  its all about the food here. A big plus is that they remain open late, making it a popular post-midnight food stop. All in all, Norani Kabab House is a must-visit if you want no-nonsense, mouthwatering desi BBQ in Karachi. Just bring your appetite  and maybe some tissue papers. Recently visited Noorani Kebab House with my family and we chose their rooftop family seating area. The ambiance was nice, especially the tables by the railing which give a good view of the road. The only slight drawback is a little BBQ smoke that reaches the tables, but nothing too overwhelming. For food, we ordered Chicken Behari Boti and Beef Behari Boti, both flavorful and well-cooked. We also tried their famous Kata Kat, customized with 2 brains, 1 heart, and 2 kidneys (all goat). It was absolutely delicious and lived up to the hype. Their raita complemented the meal really well. Personally, I found everything tasted best when paired with naan rather than parathas. Overall, it was a great experience tasty food, decent atmosphere, and a must visit for BBQ and kata kat lovers.",karachi malai boti malai boti creamy tender chunk chicken beef grill skewer want try noorani kabab house kata kat try noorani kata kat year ago today way book launch come noorani kabab house order kata kat mix plate rs kata kat mutton kidney heart kapoora mutton rib brain taste brain masala order nan paratha chapati taste well nan total bill come rs quantity taste food attract come soon seating arrangement non family footpath family seat arrangement hall kitchen area service slow shout waiter attract attention payment cash norani kabab house true taste karachis desi delight locate bustling heart karachi norani kabab house classic desi spot fail satisfy craving traditional pakistani bbq student hunt budget friendly food family look authentic karachi flavor norani kabab house deliver consistently good taste frill attach highlight menu undoubtedly chicken malai boti perfectly tender creamy burst smoky flavor seekh kabab juicy spice right serve fresh grill paratha naan chicken tikka crowd pleaser rich fiery marination bbq lover appreciate portion generous price reasonable especially consider quality freshness meat vibe local plastic chair open air seating lively noise grill sizzle background service fast expect star polish food big plus remain open late make popular post midnight food stop norani kabab house visit want nonsense mouthwatering desi bbq karachi bring appetite maybe tissue paper recently visit noorani kebab house family choose rooftop family seating area ambiance nice especially table railing good view road slight drawback little bbq smoke reach table overwhelming food order chicken behari boti beef behari boti flavorful cook try famous kata kat customize brain heart kidney goat absolutely delicious live hype raita complement meal personally find taste well pair naan paratha overall great experience tasty food decent atmosphere visit bbq kata kat lover
Lahore's Chana Chaat,"Lahore's Chana Chaat Chana Chaat A tangy, spicy chickpea salad, a popular street food snack. Pathetic experience. We visited after years because we remembered how good it used to be, but this time was completely disappointing. We overpaid for terrible service and were not even served the full meal we ordered. They have removed details from their menu so they can tweak the thalis and still charge full price. When we complained, even the manager disappeared instead of addressing the issue, and the waitress knew nothing about the menu  very unprofessional behavior. Half of the items that should have been included in the thali were missing. It wasnt even a proper thali. We will not be coming back. Please dont waste your time and money here. Ive attached pictures showing what we were served versus what should have been served. Price does not justify neither the quality nor the quantity of the food. Simple order took nearly forty minutes to serve. Drinks ordered were never served despite of several reminders. The server was hiding behind the pillar to avoid me. After I finished the meal, I asked the manager about the lime drink I ordered, she said that it cannot be served because they ran out of fresh lime, that's hilarious. Never going back there again. After many years, I have had a wonderful experience of dining in at Lahore Chatkhara, Mini market, Lahore.

Quetta's Saffron Kahva,"Quetta's Saffron Kahva Saffron Kahva Green tea infused with locally grown saffron, a luxurious and aromatic drink. If youre looking to enjoy a well-brewed cup of tea in one of Islamabads posh areas, this cafeteria is the perfect choice. The tea is wonderful, and the variety of parathas is impressive. Although the prices are slightly on the higher side, theyre well justified by the quality and ambiance. Pretty crowded place especially after the hype of their cheese paratha by foreigners. Overall they got good taste but better visit when it's less rushy otherwise prepare for long wating time. Quetta Chai offers a delightful culinary experience, particularly with their Nutella and honey parathas, which were absolutely delicious. The blend of flavors was perfect, making it a must-try for anyone visiting. However, the experience was marred by a significant issue: a large number of mosquitoes. Unfortunately, the establishment did not have any mosquito repellent measures, such as scented repellents, which are commonly used to keep these pests at bay. While the food quality is commendable and worth the visit, the lack of mosquito control significantly impacts the overall dining experience. Potential customers should be aware of this issue, especially during peak mosquito seasons.
